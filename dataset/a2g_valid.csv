Make sure there's no large that sort of thing. I'd like to listen to your heart. Take the breath in and deep. Please, open your mouth and stick your tongue. All right, Mr. Smith, my main concerns here for scoring are that you've increased your weight at a pace that's a little faster than What normally happens and with it waves, intended notice that because we sleep at night, the extra weights they put on, can actually help and can push your tongue backwards and sort of covering one pipe and then it creates snoring that you've been having. So, if you could imagine you're laying down like this. Okay? And here's your nose and this is where the airflow comes in, to windpipe, okay, here's your mouth, and your tongue just sits like that. Now, sometimes what can happen is that the time So down here in this area that can actually stop the airflow here. So what happens during this reaction to try and get oxygen in? Okay? For this, I would like to run a couple tests to do bottom of it. I will be advising you to go for a sleep study. And I can measure how well you're sleeping and delineates what's happening, what's causing the snoring. Your heart sounds sound good. And because I think it's, it's possible that you may have to also have a heart condition that's related to it. I would like to get an ECG.",,

irq,My sense is that you're trying to say something and then you just kind of almost like gave up there.,,
id,"Well, what I'm trying to talk about and I don't know what else like you want me to do. I told you that I'm not good. I'm getting something out of therapy. I feel like I'm being very clear, but I guess I'm not.",,
irq,Are you feeling angry at me?,,
id,"I mean, I'm feeling angry that the therapy isn't working. Like I've been saying. I'm feeling angry that like, I'm still in the place that I'm in. Even though I've been trying. I'm like, just feeling like, I'm feeling like pissed in general, you know? ",,
irq,"Right. So, you know, I understand that you're pissed in general. But are you angry at me? I mean, it sounds to my senses here that you're feeling angry at me right now. If you are. I really want to know about it.",,
id,"Well, I mean, I guess there is a part of me that's like a little. Yeah, a little angry. That you're not the Helping me. I came is there because I wanted to feel better. And yeah, I mean, I guess I am feeling angry that that's not like what I'm getting from you even though that's what I what I'm trying to get. So",,
irq,"yeah, you're sounding really exasperated to me. How does it feel to tell me about this?",,
id,"It feels hard. I mean, the feels hard to say that I'm angry. It's like not a feel it's not a comfortable thing to say or not a comfortable thing to feel. It's just like makes me like",,
irq,"Okay, so I want to push you too hard. But can you say any more about that while you're what's uncomfortable bother. So I mean, I do understand that it's uncomfortable. I mean,",,
id,"it's not something I would like ordinarily say to someone that I'm angry at them, so feels like, I feel like I'm kind of anxious now like even saying, like, I don't want you to think I just like that. It's like your fault. It just like feels like I'm like, that's something I'm really not supposed to say.",,
irq,"So, I mean, part of it sounds like is you're concerned that I'm going to feel like you're blaming me.",,
id,"Really? I guess. I don't want to do that. But yeah. Yeah. It is hard to feel like this. I feel like I'm alone in this therapy that like, I've been coming here and trying and I'm just not like getting anything from you. Okay, so that",,
irq,"sounds really important, right? It sounds like you're you know, it's hard to say this. But you're you know, you're feeling angry of the maybe you feeling disappointed? You're feeling all alone. Yeah, like you can't even really talk with me about this.",,
id,"Yeah, feels really hard and I want to be able to.",,
ack,Okay.,,
irq,"I'm still feeling a little anxious, but I mean, I think it's better feels better that it's like out there. I guess that I'd like said it and I think maybe that helps. ",,
id,"Okay, so let's so at least it's out there. Right.",,
irq,"So now as you kind of take a emotional inventory of your stress and worry and anxiety and you scale it, how would you put yourself now?",,
id,I think is probably closer to three now feeling more hopeful and kind of not feeling I guess maybe feeling like it's a little bit less of a big deal than I felt like when I came in,,
irq,"so some of the some of the intimidation of the concerns have been relaxed a bit as backed off,",,
id,"it comes and goes,",,
id,"it's still there. Three is still suffering, but not as much as before. And not nearly as much as the peak. ",,
ack,"Yeah, yeah.",,
ynq,"Do you think going forward, you can apply this self talk in the morning, when that automatic clock comes up, like we make that kind of plan.",,
yna,"Yeah, I think that'll be good because then also in the morning, I'll remember it's the morning and having these thoughts I need to do this.",,
id,"There are a lot of places we're going to go. As we talk about CBT and how it relates to what you're going through. I don't want to put too much on you at one time. So I'm kind of deliberately not going to a long explanation, the theory and not assigned A lot of homework, the homework is an important part of it. Okay? And one that I feel is in the best interest of clients to really take seriously and make a best effort to do. Okay. So, I'd like that to be one of the, you know, if you're okay with it, that'd be one homework steps, and the other one. So just just be two things for this week. So that self talk in the morning, and the other one was, is really just starting to cultivate an awareness in the day of when you're having these automatic thoughts. So these automatic thoughts proceed. feelings, and behaviors that you don't like, like feeling worried. So they're a little hard to pick up at first, because you're already having the feeling before you even think, to think about the thought, if that makes sense. And there's a few steps But you're already having the feeling of worry. And now I'm asking you to stop in that moment and try to recover the thought that led to that. Yeah. So that's not an easy request, satisfied to starting out with just try to bring up an awareness of that. If you can, I think super helpful, the best way is to write it down, if it's safe to do so. And if you can't, okay. So perhaps sometime today, you find yourself extra worried. And then you think back to what was going through your mind. And you find it was worrying about the welfare of the family, like a thought like, oh, they're not doing so well. Just don't judge the thought. Just write down. I was thinking to the family that might not be doing so well.",,
ack,Okay. What should I do with it? Should I like write it on a sticky note and get rid of it? Should I keep it in a journal or?,,
id,"Good question. I would say keep in touch. journal, okay, and bring it in. To the extent you're comfortable talking about, we can go over. Okay. And we'll try to together develop self talk to address that. Okay. So we're going to build, we're going to build an inventory of adaptive responses. Okay. Does that make sense? Do you have any questions about or concerns about today in common we talked about?",,
yna,"No, I mean, I think it was really helpful. I just had to remember to, you know, kind of combat things in the morning and then as the day goes by, if I notice any other thoughts, just write it down and everything. I can do that.",,
id,"I think that would be a great start. And we'll set up a time for down here for another point for next week. We'll get that all situated. But I want to Close just by letting you know, kind of my impressions from on this first session. Okay. I know you have worries, and I am working on understanding them with the family and the decision you made and I can certainly appreciate it's it's a struggle for you. At the same time I see somebody very conscientious. No, you're, you're very concerned about the work you do. You're concerned about the people you're act with. compassionate, empathetic. I see a lot of strength in terms of your ability to understand these concepts I'm talking about and apply them in your life. So I want you to take away from this I hope you take away from this, that you should be helpful. I feel like you have a lot of positive characteristics and strengths that you Bring to overcome the struggle, and I think you'll be stronger as a result of working to overcome. Does that resonate with you? How do you think of yourself?",,
id,"Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, I've worked a lot to help other people. So I think I probably do have the ability to help myself as well. And I also believe that, you know, if I do the work, then in the future, when stuff makes me stressed out, I might be a little better at handling it.",,
id,"Yeah, so I hope that you'll be able to overcome what's going on now. But also build a skill set that you can use to overcome new challenges, because you'll face new ones. And I want you to be the most prepared you can be I feel like even though you have these worries and anxieties, I want I'd like you to remember you have a lot of strengths. I feel like you can do pretty well with this. So we'll stop there. If You're good and we'll set you up for appointments next week.",,
gt,Okay. Thank you.,,
gt,"Thanks, sir.",,
gc,"I know when we met a few weeks ago, you were quite keen to look at some ways to try and manage your depression, maybe without medication. Is that what brings you in today? ",,
yna,"Yes, I'd like that.",,
gc,"Right. Okay. And I'd like to take some notes if that's okay, just to keep track of what we talked about. That'd be okay with you. ",,
yna,Yes. It'll be fine.,,
gc,You can have a Coffee to take away afterwards. And what I find quite helpful is if we talk about a specific situation. I wonder if you could just think of a time maybe a recent time when you felt particularly depressed and it affected you.,,
id,"Umm a few weeks ago, I was due to meet up with some friends from antenatal classes. We used to meet up every week. But I felt so tired and low. Just couldn't go",,
gc,"right to what was going through your mind when you're feeling tired and low, that stopped you wanting to go",,
id,"when I started thinking about the other mothers laughing and chatting, and I wouldn't have anything to say. ",,
irq,"And what would that mean, if you didn't have anything to say? ",,
id,They'd probably think that I was boring. Why would they want me there? If I was just going to make everyone else miserable?,,
irq,It sound like some really difficult thoughts to have and how did it make you feel when you're thinking that ?,,
id,really low,,
gc,"Okay, it's really understandable. I think that you'd feel low if you're having quite self critical, very negative thoughts and that it's quite common in depression to have those type of thoughts. Did it make you think anything about how they might see you, for example?",,
id,"Will the other children always seem so happy, I started thinking maybe the other mother is doing a better job than me. And I worry a lot about Molly and wondered if she'd be better off for one or the other mums.",,
gc,Right. Okay. I'm not that that must be really painful. And how does it make you feel to think that Molly might be better off with one or the other moms?,,
id,That made me feel really sad,,
irq,What tells you that Molly might be better off with one or the other moms?,,
id,We seem so in control with my depression. I just feel guilty that I'm not very good mother.,,
irq,"You've mentioned a number of emotional feelings. You said you feel fed up, low, sad and sometimes guilty. Do you have any physical symptoms or body reactions?",,

ynq,Are you getting good sleep at the moment?,,
yna,"Molly keeps me up sometimes at night that makes me tired. But even after a good night's sleep, I'm still exhausted ",,
ack,right,,
ynq,Oh Hello there is there Ms Dorsey?,,
yna,yeah.,,
irq,How can I help you today?,,
id,"I'm sorry, I might be wasting your time a bit, but I can't. I'm not sleeping very well. I'm just exhausted. And just wondered if you could give me something anything to help me sleep some sleeping tablets.",,
id,"Okay. It really helped me if I could ask a few more questions about how you feeling? Yeah, maybe symptoms and then we can sort of see how it can help you with that'd be okay.",,
ack,"Yeah, I think yes.",,
irq,So why don't you tell me a bit more about what's brought you here today?,,
id,"Umm but a year ago my husband were split up and since I was coping very much. I'm just tired all the time. And kids, job just punch him very well. I can't sleep. ",,

And like, then I can't focus on my work because I just hear it. So I try to put on music. And then my boss will get upset because I have earbuds in but I can't play music out loud because I'm trying to be considerate of other people. Unlike my cubicle mate, the guy the other cubicle, then, you know, that's just like one example. And then like, when I'm driving home, there was this guy walking his dog on the side of the road, and like there's no shoulder so it's not a safe place. So, like, I just feel like he's risking his life and his dog's life and my life. I get home and I kept thinking about it.

gc,And this irritable mood has been bothering you work any and you mentioned driving home and the other places.,,
gc,"I mean, yeah, just because it's not just at work and driving home like, you know, something my mom said on the phone The other day irritated me. And then I cut the phone call shore and I get to talk to my dad, because I was mad. And so that like affected that. So a little bit of like, my personal life to",,
ynq,any drug or alcohol usage. There's really nothing.,,
yna,No,,
ynq,Have you ever seen or heard things other people can't see or hear?,,
yna,"No, ",,
ynq,that's never happened.,,
yna,No,,

gt,"All right, ",,
gt,so I'll get that arranged. And I want to thank you for answering these questions has been helpful.,,
irq,any other evidence that points toward you being imposter?,,
id,Besides My bad grade? Not a whole lot.,,
cr,Right. So to be safe to say that a lot of that thought of I'm not good enough is kind of based on your feelings of anxiety.,,
yna,Yeah. Which are really intense like panic almost in the moment.,,
cr,Yeah so in a way you're believing With the anxiety will lead you to believe.,,
yna,"Yeah, definitely. ",,
id,"But in the bright light of scrutiny, there are a lot of facts to support the worst case, which is you don't deserve it. How about evidence that refutes that you're not good enough?",,
id,"I would say that, you know, I was accepted into the program. Like there's kind of like, a pretty rigorous sort of testing and stuff, which I passed, to get interviews and such to get into the program. So I did that. Like I said, I'm a pretty good student, all considering, you know, before this kind of flick was happening.",,
id,"Okay, so you've got through a rigorous process to become a student You're doing well. You mentioned before, just the one bad grade right? Okay, so if you have friends in this program, right, if one of them came to you with this, this balance of, you know, one bad grade and some anxiety, yeah, versus passing, you know, rigorous standards and doing well, otherwise, what advice would you give them?",,
id,"I mean, now that you're kind of like talking about it, like, you know, this or that sort of thing. It makes sense. I would probably say that, well, you seem to be doing pretty well so far. You know, that anyone evaluating would look at all of the cumulative how you're doing your performance, rather than that one grade",,
irq,would you feel comfortable giving advice to yourself?,,
id,"I think I tried to sometimes, but my anxiety symptoms kind of like really, like you were saying, your anxiety tells you sort of I think I can think that but I think my anxiety symptoms are such in the moment that it's really hard. You know, and I'm replaying what happened before in my head anticipation predicting will happen again.",,
irq,"So, so let's look at the the thought and the feeling. If you had to rate the percent that you believed this thought, this belief that you are not good enough to be in the program, like right now right now, yeah, but here with me. How much of your mind believes that that's true?",,
id,"I would say like, you know, a two or three like not very, I don't believe it very much right now because You know, I'm not presenting and it's just you and I not like a group full of people. So that pressure is not there here.",,
irq,So right now you're really not buying the idea that you're not good enough.,,
yna,"Yeah, that is correct ",,
irq,"So now let's move to let's say right in the near the end of presentation when that anxiety is there, and the classmates that could be looking at you, it could be negatively evaluating you because you're worried about how much do you believe that thought then?",,
id,"I don't feel really confident. In that moment. It feels very real. Like, like any moment, they're gonna kick me out. Like, I'm just not doing well. I'm stuffing.",,
irq,"Yeah. really intense. So would you think that you were a more accurate evaluator of what's true or not. Now, or when you're in that state of anxiety,",,
id,"definitely now that anxiety that, you know, heart rate and sweating is not there.",,
irq,"So this evaluation, the percent that you believe that true, this evaluation is more accurate?",,
yna,"Yes, I think so.",,
irq,"And how much time in any given day would you spend kind of in a mood right now, or you can evaluate accurately?",,
id,"I would say, you know, when I'm not at risk of presenting, like, I feel like I spend the majority of my time, like, it's not something I worry about all the time, just leading up to and then mostly that day,",,
irq,"okay. So the, so you're able to evaluate the way you are now, the vast majority of the time, right? There's a limited amount of time when you're not when there's A lot of motions going through, right? And at those times, you're maybe a little less reliable,",,
yna,right. Like my judgment is clouded.,,
ynq,"However, in that moment you still, those thoughts are strong, right? ",,
yna,"Yes, very troubling. ",,
irq,"Even though it's a small percentage, it's intense. And you kind of carry that around a little bit.",,
yna,Yeah. Exactly.,,
id,So I can see why this is frustrating for you.,,
gt,"Well, thanks for asking. Yeah, I understand you've had some recent difficulties that brought you into our agency.",,

My sister was over last week and she threw something away. She threw this newspaper away from two years ago. And I freaked out I would if I need that, you know, I those things are important to me.

gc,something away,,
id,"Yeah, yeah, so yeah it's just it's embarrassing that I can count on my friends over look like to have my family over and I just can't it's too much ",,

id,"there's there's room for me to live in there. And there's a path from my front door to the kitchen. The two bedroom, two bath Sometimes it's blocked by stuff, but when things fall or whatever, are pretty much the whole house says things",,
irq,and what what type of things. You mentioned a newspaper.,,
id,"Yeah, I don't like to get rid of like cards or newspapers or magazines, mail, things like that. But I've also collected things over the years. I inherited the house where my grandmother's all her stuff was in there. And yeah, I really can't get rid of that. But it has a lot of sentimental value to me. So my things have just kind of been piled up on her things.",,
id,"So you have a lot of stuff in the house. And it's congested, but you're able to move around and live there.",,
id,"Yeah, I'm not freely able to move around, but you know, it works for me.",,

yna,"Yeah, I like to go shopping. I like to get the yard sales on the weekends. Kind of a deal Hunter. So if I if I see something on sale, I don't want to pass it up. If it's a good deal, man, we'll come back to it. So",,
irq,How often do you buy things?,,
id,I probably like on the weekends I go to yard sales. I usually buy a few things every weekend from the yard sales and they're such good deals so man make a trip to the mall or TJ Maxx or something once a week at least I usually buy something I need to,,
