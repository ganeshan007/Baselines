b,Okay.,,

%,But yeah.,,
sd,"That's what always amazes me, actually, is that, um, is that, you know",,

sd,We look alike,,
sd,we act alike,,
sd,we sound alike,,

%,"Well, that's",,
sv,"to me it's really, um",,
sv,"I guess, I guess I can intellectually kind of come to grips with all of that.",,

b,Right.,,

sd,"But I mean, even within the Muslim, uh, religions, different sects, they can't get together.",,
b,Right.,,
sv,"That's, that's actually the part that, that, that I find really strange.",,
sd,"I mean, I, I, I sort of understand somewhat.",,
%,"I mean, I, I",,
sd,"knowing the history I understand that, the hatred of the Muslims for, you know, the Israelis or whatever",,
sd,and I can sort of handle that,,

b,Yeah.,,

b,Yeah.,,
%,In this,,
sd,"and it talks about how, you know, if we could just all get toge-, you know",,
sd,when we were young everything was great because we all went to class together,,
%,"and in the mi-, you know",,
sd,we all had snack time together,,
sd,and then we all took naps,,
sd,"and we all held hands and hugged, you know",,
sd,"and, and, and that's what kindergarten was like",,
sv,"and wouldn't it be nice if, if we could solve all our problems by just sort of getting together and everyone in the world sat down and took a nap together.",,
sd,"Woke up and had snack time, you know, and then hugged each other as we left.",,
sv,"It sounds like a, it sounds like a John Lennon, uh, type.",,
b,Yeah,,
sd,. I wonder if he secretly did that ...,,
o,Okay.,,
qy,Are you a T I -er,,
%,or,,
nn,No,,
sd^e,I'm not.,,
b,"Oh, really",,
ba,that's great.,,
sd^t,"Uh, my daughter talked to a student.",,
sd^t,"Uh, in general most of them, uh, people doing this are T I -ers",,
qy^d^t,"but I guess customers too, huh ?",,

b,Yeah.,,
sv^t,"T I -s got, uh, a lot of advances in it really.",,
sd^t,"Uh, hopefully this will turn out to be a good program for us.",,
sv^t,"We sure need, uh, the business.",,
b,Okay,,
sd^t,Current Events.,,
ad^t,"Uh, you, you've got the question you can go first there, since I called.",,
sd,"I rely primarily on, uh, newspaper combined with television.",,
%,"Huh, that",,
sd,you're the opposite of me.,,
sd,I drive an hour each way to work,,
sd,and so if I just use time,,
sd,"and not say one, which quality is the best",,
sd,"I guess, that would be two hours roughly of talk shows and news on radio",,
sd,"and then newspapers and T V would be tied after that because maybe I'll catch the, the evening news, like ten o'clock on T V",,
%,and I,,
b,Uh.,,
sd,so that's a half an hour roughly the same with newspaper.,,
b,Okay.,,
%,I really,,
sd,"of course, you, you're in a different part of the country",,
sd,"I, I really listen to a lot of the talk shows, I don't mean the gossip ones",,
%,but there's a lot,,
sd,"of, on the weekends when I do chores, or whatever",,
sd,I'm a radio hound I guess,,
sd,"I take the radio with me when I'm working on my car, the lawn or whatever",,
%,and turn on,,
sd,"they have everything from lawn work, lawyers, news, uh, veterinarians, all kinds of items, uh",,
sd,"so I'm, I'm a real radio buff, especially on the w-, when I'm doing chores.",,
ba,That's rather interesting.,,
b,Yeah,,
sd,"I find it surprising. Because a lot of times, it, here, you know",,
sd,I'll talk to some people here,,
sd,"and I'll mention someone's, some talk host",,
sv,and I'll expect them to have an opinion on why I don't like him and don't listen,,
sd,they don't even know,,
+,"you know, what the guys name is, uh. Bruce Williams who does financial work all over the United States.",,
sv,Most people haven't heard of Bruce Williams.,,
sv,You probably haven't either unless you're a radio buff.,,
aa,"I'd, I'd have to say I haven't either.",,
sd,He is in New Jersey and is entrepreneur and kind of a self-made millionaire.,,
%,"And, he has it",,
%,I,,
sd,well it's five seventy here,,
%,I'm trying to,,
%,it's on Cliff,,
sd,I don't know what the,,
sd,he's on all stations.,,
sd,You might remember the name Bruce Williams,,
sd,"and he, he is again, national and talks about a lot of financial things.",,
sd,"But, the here, I just get a kick out of, uh",,
sd,well we do a lot of gardening here,,
%,so there's,,
sd,we have an excellent gardener here,,
sd,has three hours on Sunday and three hours on Saturday.,,
sd^t,Of course that's not exactly current events.,,
sd,"But, I, I'm, I am kind of a radio buff.",,
sd,"I listen to the radio, uh, probably g-, five or six hours a week",,
sd,"but almost inevitably to a station that is a classical, uh, station here MUMBLEx",,
^2,For music ?,,
+,for music purposes.,,
sd,We don't use the radio as a wake up,,
sd,"we have our, a television connected to a, uh, uh, electronic alarm",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,"uh, system that kicks in",,
sd,and it comes on with C N N in the morning.,,
b,"Oh, yeah.",,
ba,That's good.,,
%,Actually,,
%,That,,
sd,"we, we wake up to television news and, uh, uh, shower and dress, and whatever to that",,
sd,"and then because of the fact that my wife and I ride to work together, uh, in a car",,
ba,"Oh, that's good.",,
+,"we, we chat at each other rather than, than something else.",,
sd,"Uh, and occasionally what we'll each do depending on whoever is driving is have the newspaper sort of on our lap on the way in, in the car",,
sd,"so we have the advantage of being able to, uh, read and drive although there seems to be, from what I've seen on the freeway recently that a fair number of people are reading and driving.",,
sd,My wife always wonders about that,,
sd(^q),"she says, look at that person he's driving and reading at the same time.",,
sv,"So, we, we rely pretty, pretty heavily, I think, on a combination of the, of the two.",,
sd,"I also, uh, use, uh, NEWSWEEK magazine. Uh",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,we tend to alternate between NEWSWEEK and TIME and whatever happens to be the,,
b,Right.,,
+,"the, uh, news magazine of the year for us.",,
%,"W-, we get",,
sd,"and, uh, I read sporadically of commentary and a couple of other, you know, trade magazines, and, uh, uh, such as that, uh, where I might read the, the occasional social and even current event commentaries, and, and everything as diverse as A C M to, uh, uh, some of the, uh, some of the other tabloids I get.",,
sd,"So, uh, I guess I use about eighty percent written, is probably my input and twenty percent, uh, television.",,
sv,I,,
ad,Go ahead,,
+,"I think I respect the, from a journalistic perspective current events.",,
sv,"I've always said that it, it's really not interesting unless it's three weeks old and found its way into a news weekly headline.",,
aa,Good point.,,
aa,That's a good point.,,
sd,"Uh, other than that it was a MUMBLEx at best.",,
b,"Oh, yeah.",,
sd,It comes and goes.,,
sd,"Uh, we're probably not thrilled with our only newspaper that we have in Raleigh.",,
%,"There, there are other, uh, uh",,
sd,"I'm not sure what you would call them, they co-, the small, uh, competing independent sort of newspapers.",,
sd,Little small weekly things,,
sd,"but there's only one daily, uh, called the NEWS AND OBSERVER, fondly referred to here by some as the, uh, uh, sometimes the Noise and Observer.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"Uh, it depends.",,
sv,"It, it's, has decent national coverage, but has an extremely focused political coverage, probably steeped in",,
b^m,Local you mean ?,,

sv,"And, uh, consequently everything is filtered through that, uh, Republican Democratic sort of",,
b,Yeah.,,

%,and,,
bk,Okay,,

sv,"So, I think we find out what's happening in the city, uh, on a fairly frequent basis, over a, over a gin and tonic sort of thing.",,
aa,Yeah.,,
aa,Right.,,
sv,"Uh, and that probably gives us a better insight as to the city of Raleigh than, than the paper would have anyway.",,
sd,"My wife and I, you know, as mentioned",,
sd^t,"the question was, uh, do you get it from people too.",,
sd,"And, and, I can say the same thing you do that, uh, my wife is, uh, she reads the paper from front to back",,
sd,and so she'll tell me some stuff,,
sd(^q),"and she'll always get mad and say, you didn't read the, uh",,
sd,"well, I always read the sports, uh",,

aa,yeah.,,

sv,"And they don't have to go get one, you know.",,
sv,"One thing I like about the paper, um, as opposed to television is that, uh, when I, like when I report, because I'm in television, I have to get the basic, the main facts and that's it.",,
sv,That's all you have time for.,,
b,Right.,,
b^r,Right.,,

b,Right.,,

sd,"Well, that's why I like, uh, national public radio",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,because they get on one of these little things,,
sd,they give you headlines that are brief,,
%,just,,
sd,they touch on what's going on.,,
sd,And then they'll get into something and really explore it.,,
b,Uh-huh,,
b^r,uh-huh.,,
sv,"And it's, it's informative.",,
sv,"It's a lot more informative than, you know, quick, half hour news shows that",,

b,Yeah,,
sd,because that's what we do.,,
sd,"I mean it's like each story is thirty seconds, you know.",,
b,Right.,,

sv,You can't afford to give more than a couple of seconds here and there.,,
sv,"I think that is one good thing, one great thing, about news",,

b,Yeah.,,
sd,"Whatever happened, we knew about it about the same time that they knew about it.",,

b,Uh-huh.,,
qh,"Is it, is it the true story",,
qrr,or is it a,,
b,Yeah.,,

qh,"So all we had to sit here and, and ask is well, what aren't they telling us, you know.",,

%,But we,,
sd,I talked to one woman,,

b,Yeah.,,

sd,She's eaten my crepe myrtle trees.,,
ba,Oh dear.,,
ba,I know,,
sd,and she's eaten the bushes.,,
sd,"I've tried to, I spent like eight hours planting this nice garden out there",,
nn,No.,,
sd,and I barricaded it up,,

b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,And I went and took a shower and looked back out there,,
sd,and she was already in it.,,
sd,And I was so mad.,,
bf,Had somehow gotten in.,,
x,.,,
sd,So I can't do anything back,,
b,Yeah.,,
+@,there.,,
b,Yeah.,,
+@,"Because she just, she destroys it.",,
sd,But I've tried out in the front,,
sd(^q),"but like you said that, that freeze that came.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"I had some bushes that, uh, some shrubs I pu, put out front",,
sd,and it killed those too.,,
sd,"So, I'm just real discouraged with the whole thing.",,
sd,I just don't even want to do anything.,,
sd,"The, the other problem that we have",,
sd,"well it's funny because the one, the two bushes on the ends of the house that I think are ugly, they lived",,
h,"and so I, I don't know.",,
b,Yeah,,
sd,"that, that happened to us.",,
sd,We have these,,
sd,So like I wanted to go out and kill them too.,,
ba,I know.,,
sd,They had no right to live.,,
sd,"But anyway, uh, under our trees we get a, a north sun",,
%,"and, uh, the",,
sd,it looks like our trees don't have any grass under them.,,
ba,"Oh, I know.",,
sd,Ours don't.,,
sd,"And we just can't grow, uh, grass underneath there.",,
ba,I know,,
sd,we can't either.,,
sd,"But I've got pre-, two good size cottonwood trees out in my front yard. Uh, you know one on either side of the yard.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And, and they're big",,
sd,"and MUMBLEx they're real full and everything, you know, in the summer time",,
sd,"but it, it's killing everything underneath",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,where the leaves are shading the tree,,
sd,"but toward the end of the summer, you know, when everything starts dying off and whatnot and then the light can get through the tree, then the grass starts growing.",,
sd,"But, by then it's so late then the winter comes and it stops.",,
sv,"You know, it's, it's",,
b,Right.,,
+,it's a never ending cycle.,,
qy^g,It's a vicious cycle,,
+,isn't it ?,,
ny,Yeah,,
sd^e,it really is.,,
sd,It just really,,
sd,"So we've been trying to get something or to pull some grass underneath there and, and whatnot.",,
%,So,,
%,"Well, I don't",,
sd,we've never done anything like this,,
sd,"but we've been thinking, you know, if we built up, uh, you know, either a wood, wooden like trench thing around where our bushes were and filled it like with a nice dirt",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,then maybe we could plant some either flowers,,
+,"or, or some new bushes in there that would live.",,
sd,And so I think that we're going to try that.,,
b,Huh.,,
sd,"I, I think the, I think that's pretty much what we have decided.",,
sd,Now I have two long windows,,
sd@,and I'm trying to decide whether to put like bushes in front of them or not.,,
b,Yeah.,,
+@,"You know, maybe just halfway up the window or something like that. So people can't see and hear too much.",,
b,Really.,,
%,C-,,
sd,well I don't really have to worry about that that much because my sons' bedrooms are in the front,,
sd,and they've got mini-blinds and stuff.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"But only, only one is really like in the flower bed part",,
sd,and the other one is out on the porch.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,So there's not really much I can do about that.,,
sd,"That's what our two rooms are on the front, too, with these long windows.",,
sd,"One is a bedroom for our, our oldest son",,
sd,"and one is, uh, an office that my husband and I work in.",,
sd,"And so, I, I really don't like it too much because then the back of our house faces that",,
sd,"well, the flowers are out by the back of the house",,
sd,"so, and that's why the front room is.",,
sd,So that's not too bad.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"But, I like to look at the flowers.",,
sd,They're pretty.,,
aa,I do too,,
sd,that's why I look at my neighbors yard.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,I don't have anything to look at,,
sd,so I look at theirs.,,
sv,"But it's funny because, uh, you try so hard I think sometimes to, to, anyway I do, to do our yard",,
b,Uh-huh,,
x,.,,
sd,and then it's like the wind blows everything whether the weeds from your yard to your neighbors or yours,,
b,Yeah,,
x,.,,
+,to them,,
sv,"or and so even if you did get it under control, it seems like in just a few months it would all be back",,
%,and,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"It, it's really a pain.",,
sd,My husband works a lot,,
sd,"so, um, a lot",,
^2,It's hard to get out a lot and do that yard work.,,
b,Yeah,,
%,. I'm,,
sd,it's usually me and the kids that go out and mow the yard,,
sd,and,,
b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,"I hate to mow the yard, more than anything else.",,
sd,I hate to mow that yard.,,
ba,I know.,,
sd,"It is, it's not my favorite",,

sd,I'm glad I have an old enough son to do it for me now.,,
b,Yeah,,
sd,well mine's getting there.,,
sd,He helps,,
sd,he does half,,
sd,and I do half,,
o@,so.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,

b,Yeah.,,
+@,Whether he likes it or not.,,
b,Yeah,,
sd,". Well that is one chore that we will pay him for, if he'll go do the yard work out, outside",,
o@,so,,
sv,Oh sure I'll be more then glad to pay him,,

aa,Right.,,
aa,Exactly.,,

aa,Exactly.,,

b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,"I, I sew clothes for them every once in a while.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,And I make quilts.,,
ba,"Oh, wow",,
sd,that's the next project that I'd like to learn to do.,,
sd,I do mostly hand needlework like cross stitch and crewel embroidery,,

sd,and then I have to bring it back.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,"I don't know if it's looking at the little th-, things every time.",,
sv,"Well, it reaches a point where it doesn't seem to be very challenging, I think.",,
aa,Yeah,,
aa,that might be it.,,
sd,But I do,,
aa^r,That might,,

%,We,,
bh,"Oh, do you ?",,
ny,Yeah,,
sd^e,we commute from Plano to Dallas,,
b,Oh.,,
sd,so I have nearly an hour both ways that I can really get a lot of work done,,
sd,and,,
ba,"Oh, I bet.",,

b,Yeah.,,
sd,I don't know that I could even think about quilting.,,
qy^g,"You have to have a pretty good frame, don't you, to",,
ny,Yeah.,,

ny,Yeah.,,
sd^e,"Uh, I've not really done any, too much challenging, uh, stuff.",,
sd,"I, I can do it with a, a needle and thread",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,but it's very long.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"It's very tedious if you don't have a whole group, you're not finishing a quilt in a long time.",,
ba,"Oh, I bet.",,
%,"So, uh",,
sv,"But, it's such a lost art.",,
sd,"So, uh, I like to just mostly do the tie quilts.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,That's so much easier.,,
aa,Yes.,,
sd,"But, uh, the other ones are very pretty.",,

ba,I bet.,,
sd^r,It's real pretty.,,
sd,There's so many things I wish I had learned to do with my mother.,,

qh,"And when I look at it now, she's been dead for a long time",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

b,Uh-huh.,,

qy,Now did you say you could knit ?,,
nn,No.,,
b,Oh.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,Haven't tried that either.,,
sv,"Well, I was going to say because",,
sd,I want to learn to crochet.,,
%,I,,
+,"Because if you could knit, you could crochet.",,
bh,Really ?,,
sv,"It's just like doing one handed as long as you learn how to, to weave the, the yarn in between your fingers on your left hand.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,And then you just use your right hand with the hook.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
%,And that's not,,
sd,it's really not too difficult.,,
sv,"You could learn that, I'm sure",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,and pick that up.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,"If you, I think if you can do any handicraft, you can learn to crochet.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,It's not too difficult.,,
sd,"It's funny, when you were talking about sewing, I love to do anything by hand with a needle.",,
b,Yeah,,
x,.,,
sd,But I'm totally intimidated if I sit down at a sewing machine.,,
sd,I never learned,,
sd,and I get real nervous whereas usually the other needlework stuff is relaxing to me.,,
qh,Isn't that interesting.,,
sd,But I just have a phobia about not being able to actually sew.,,
sv,I think that's really interesting.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
b,Huh.,,
sd,"And yet, you know, I think about, you know",,
sd(^q),you said you do a lot of needlework,,
sd,"and, and there are some beautiful, just gorgeous patterns",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,that people do.,,
sd,"And I, I just think that, uh, that's one of, one of the arts that I think are really pretty.",,
sv,And a lot of people don't do that either.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
%,"You know, and so",,
sd,"Well, it's hard to find the time.",,
sv,"I, I wouldn't if I didn't have this car time ability probably",,
b,Yeah.,,

b,Yeah.,,
+,just not sitting down at all.,,
aa,That's true.,,
sd,"You know, and, and I always think, well, I can do this and watch T V or something",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,you know.,,
sd,"And, uh, it seems like I always get my mind carried away to something else",,
sd,and then it doesn't,,
%,"Well, it",,
+,quite work,,
%,or,,
sd,I'm at the age where bifocals or trifocals would be necessary.,,
sd,"It's so I find myself putting glasses on to, to watch T V and then taking them off to do needlework",,
sd,and I get frustrated doing that,,
sd,so. Just give it up.,,
sd,"And, you know, I like to sketch.",,
sd,"I can, I can sketch something, like if I see a picture, like, out of a book, I can sketch that",,
b,Ooh.,,
sd,and that's nice and everything,,
sd,"but, you know, it's funny",,
sd,"I can't, I can't draw it out of my own head",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,I wish I could.,,

b,Yeah.,,
%,And yet,,
aa,I'm the same way.,,

aa,Yeah,,
aa,"me, too.",,
aa^r,"Me, too.",,
sd,I know a woman who's just wonderful at that.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,

sv,and you wish so badly that you could do them.,,
sv,"I guess, if you wanted to, you could take classes and learn.",,
sd,I guess that's the only way I could do it.,,
sd,"Well, sometimes, even with that. I, I think you have to have some",,
o,Okay,,
qw,what kind of fishing do you do ?,,
sd,"Well, mostly, uh, a, a little fresh water fish",,
sd,but mostly lake fishing like rainbow trout and stuff because I used to live in Utah.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"But, uh, down here I haven't fished much in Texas.",,
sd,That's one of the few things I've ever fished for is rainbow trout.,,
sd,"Oh, they're really not",,
sv,I think they're good to eat.,,
qw,"What, what kind of bait do you use to catch them ?",,
sd,"Oh, just, usually worms, night crawlers.",,
sd,Sometimes fish eggs.,,
bh,"Oh, really ?",,
na,Sometimes.,,
b^m,Fish eggs ?,,
ny,Yeah.,,
sd,"Oh, I didn't know that.",,
b,Huh.,,
sd,"Just little, just little fish eggs.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And, uh, there's this one kind of cheese that you can put on the end of a hook",,
sd,and it will stay relatively well.,,
sd,"Oh, I didn't know that.",,
b,Yeah,,
ba,That's a great way.,,
sd,"and, and they really like that.",,
sv,I think that would probably be a good way to catch catfish,,
sd@,also.,,
sd,Now I have never caught catfish.,,
+@,"Oh, look, catfish, uh",,
sd,personally I like to catch large mouth bass,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,and catfish because they fight the best.,,
sd,Because they fight the best.,,
sd,"But a, a catfish will really just tear into anything like that, like liver",,
bh,"Oh, is that right ?",,
+,"or, uh, cheese or anything that smells terrible.",,
qy,Now in Amarillo did you fish any of this ?,,
nn,"Uh, no.",,
sd^e,Actually I always used to go to my grandparents' in Oklahoma,,
b@,Um.,,
sd,"and they have the, uh, Lake Texoma right next to them.",,
+@,Uh-huh.,,
%,So the,,
sd,"we used to catch some, uh, sand bass off Lake, there's a Roosevelt Bridge",,
sd,"and what we'd do is let the line all the way to the bottom and crank up, you know",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,turns on the,,
b,Right.,,
+,reel about six to twelve times,,
sd,and the fish would be sitting at different levels.,,
ba,"Oh, how about that.",,
b,"So, yeah",,
sd,you just leave it at that level,,
sd,and in no time something would hit it,,
sd,and you could pull them up two and three times in a row,,
sd,"but you had to find out what level, how many cranks they were off the bottom.",,
sd,"And if you left it on the bottom, there was a good chance that you'd catch catfish.",,
b,Oh.,,
sd,"And, of course, depending on how big your bait was, uh, you know, would be depending on what you caught.",,
ba,"Oh, I think that is really interesting.",,
b,Yeah,,
sd,that was a lot of fun.,,
sd,My grandfather used to do that,,
sd,and we used to have a light at the top of the water.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,He'd really spoiled me in that respect.,,
%,I think they're,,
sd,"see, and I wish I could go fishing here because I don't really know much about the fishing here.",,
%,I guess it would,,
sd,"if you did it like you were just, uh, saying, that's pretty much like rainbow trout.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,You bait the hook,,
sd,you throw it in,,
sd,you troll it,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,a little bit,,
sd,and then you wait,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,and they troll it a little bit.,,
%,"Well, if you",,
qy,do you have any friends with ponds ?,,
nn,No.,,
sd^e,I don't.,,
%,"I, uh",,
%,"well, if you can fi-",,
sd,"well, or even a lake.",,
%,"If, uh",,
sv,"seems like every time somebody's on the bank, all they want to do is throw it out just as far as they can",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,"and, uh, bring it in to you.",,
sd,But it's the opposite when you're fishing from a boat.,,
sd,"You, you want to l-, make it land right on the shore and then drag like a plastic worm",,
b,"Oh, uh-huh.",,
+,"and just have it come into the water like a, a regular animal or, or fish",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"uh, well, you know, something coming off from the bank like they usually do.",,
sd,"So you don't have to really get, uh, fish from a boat, you know, because they're actually right there at the shore.",,
b,Huh.,,
sd,"But, I didn't used to be sold on plastic worms",,
%,"but, uh, if",,
sd,I am now.,,
b^m,You are now.,,
b,"Oh, yeah",,
x,.,,
sd,I've never used those.,,
sd,That's really interesting.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"It just, uh, just a slow reel",,
sd,and then let it sit on the bottom,,
sd,but the key is to always have your line tight.,,
b,Yeah,,
b^r,yeah.,,
sd,And that way you can feel when they're hitting it,,
sd,and believe me you'll know the difference.,,
qw,"Uh, what kind of fish do you like the best to eat ?",,
sd,"Oh, crappie actually.",,
^g,"Oh, do you ?",,
ny,Yeah,,
sd^e,". I've been fishing in the, the ocean.",,
sd,We're about three hours from the ocean.,,
sd,And I also like Spanish mackerel.,,
b@,Um.,,

qy,Have you ever fished off the pier ?,,

sd^e,I've done fishing like that,,
qw^d,"but, but, uh, tell me what, uh, where you'd catch crappie.",,
sd,"My, my neighbor has gone before",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"and, and done that",,
%,but,,
sd,"Oh, the best thing for crappie is those little spinner baits and, and jigs.",,
sd,"Uh, they have like yellow, uh, fuzz on a hook, you know, that kind of comes out.",,
ba,"Oh, oh, I know.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"Uh, they're sort of like, well, I want to say flies",,

sd,and they're bigger.,,
b,Yeah.,,
ad,Get the yellow ones.,,
b^m,The yellow.,,
aa,Those are the ticket.,,
b,Okay.,,
ad,"And let them drop to the bottom and maybe do a, a kind of a slow reel.",,
sd,"You don't even have to have a good rod or anything. Just, just even a regular line",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

b,Uh-huh,,

qo,So what do you think ?,,
sv,"Well, I think the public school systems are doing a good job.",,
sv,I think they have a long way to go yet,,
sv,"but I think that, um, they are starting to head towards more technology and getting the kids computer literate earlier.",,
sd,"You know, my kindergartners were on the, were on the computers",,
sv,and I think that with the way the world is today that's got to be done.,,
sv,"And I think that, uh, the schools now are starting to teach thinking strategies more than just giving them, you know, skills.",,
o@,You know,,
b,Right.,,
+@,you don't just add one plus one,,
sv,you figure out why you're adding it and what you're going to do with it once you've got it together.,,

sv,they literally can not come in out of the rain.,,
aa,That's right.,,
%,"You know, and that just",,
sv,I don't care how intelligent you are if you be can not make it function for you that intelligence is being wasted.,,
b,Right.,,
sd,"And, uh, this has been one of my pet peeves and probably why I went into education.",,
sv,"So I think, you know, they're, they're trying to head them into teaching them to think and use the education that they have",,
sv,"and I think that's very, very important.",,
aa,Yes,,
aa,it is.,,
sv,"I, I agree with you that they're starting children so much earlier on things because our grandchildren",,
sd,"we have a, uh, fourth grader",,
sd,and then we have one that's in kindergarten,,

qy,Is that scary ?,,
x,.,,
sd,"And it's like, oh, I going to take this home and study it before I can help you.",,
b,Right.,,
sd,"You know, so they're really, they're really moving them along",,

%,Now,,
%,"And that's wha-, you know",,
sd,a lot of the things that we did in school I've never used and never will use.,,
b,Yes.,,

aa,Correct.,,
qy,"Are you finding that, uh, since you're doing substitute, that you're wanting to do full-time ?",,

^2,Coming up,,
b,uh-huh.,,

sv,And I think that's totally useless.,,
sv,"I think, you know, there's a place and a time for all of the tests and comparisons",,

sv,It's like bragging on your grandchildren.,,
b,Right.,,
sv,"You know, and everybody's kids are the best kids that have ever hit this earth",,
sv,and nobody else's children are going to ever live up to this,,

qy,"do you see as, uh, the changes that have occurred in the last MUMBLEx",,
sd,Beverly.,,
sv,I think one of the thing that I notice a lot,,
sd,I know it's touching social changes,,
sd,"but, uh, to me what becomes socially acceptable",,
sd,"and I, I don't know if it's a factor of me growing older and seeing things through different eyes or if it's a factor of our society actually moving in that direction",,
sv,"but I notice things on T V being more, um, open, more I believe, uh",,
sd,they portray things on T V obviously that they never would have years ago,,
sd,"and, you know, and specifically, nudity, things like that, uh",,
h,I don't know,,
sv,"I, I've said several times to my husband that I feel like gee, in ten years they'll have just full nudity on T V",,
sv,and nobody will think anything of it,,
sv,and to me that's surprising.,,
sv,"To me, that's, that's a big change to accept it",,
sv,"and it comes across, I think subtly, you know, a little at a time, to where you get so used to seeing a little change, that, you know, when they go one step further, you don't notice it that much.",,
sd,That's one of the biggest ones I've seen.,,
aa,Huh,,
aa,yeah,,
aa,that's a big one.,,
qo,What about you ?,,
sv,"Well, I think that society has come to a point where they're not responsible for any of their actions.",,
sv,"Somebody else, uh, made them do it.",,
sv,"Uh, that's what I seem to see a lot of, that, uh, no one is willing to take responsibility for their life and their choices.",,
sv(^q),"It's rather, sue these guys because they made a foo-, uh, a seat belt that didn't work right",,
sv,or,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"uh, that's what I think is a big one.",,
aa,I tend to agree with you,,
sv,and I think there's a lot of that.,,
%,"Um, yeah",,
sv,we have become lawsuit happy.,,
sv,"Any little thing, it's like let's see what I can get.",,
sv(^q),"Don't you think that maybe a lot of that came from, um, oh, you know, the, the, the era we went through that was like, you know, hey if it makes you happy, do it.",,
sv,"You know, kind of like, disregard to others",,
^q,do what makes you happy,,
%,"and, and yes",,
sv,"we should take care of ourselves, you know",,
sv,"and we should see to our own lives, but not to a total disregard of others.",,
h,"Um, I don't know",,
sv,I think it's come to that a lot.,,
sd,I see it a lot in my daughter.,,
sd,I have a four year old.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,And hers isn't a social thing as much as it's a stage they go through,,
sd(^q),"but whenever something happens it's, you made me hit that",,
^q,you made me do this,,
sd,"and so I try to tell her, MUMBLEx, everything isn't always somebody else's fault.",,
sv,"You know, you have to watch where you're going",,
sd,and,,
b,Sure.,,
+,"and so it's what you just said, kind of hits home to me, just through her.",,
o@,So.,,
b,Yeah,,
sv,"and, another thing I think has changed quite a bit is, uh, the roles that men and women play.",,
sd,That's really in the last thirty years has changed significantly.,,
+@,I think you're right.,,
qr,"Um, in your opinion, good or bad, or both ?",,
sd,"Well, both, you know",,
sd,"there's some great things that, uh, have come about with more equality",,
sv,but I think that also,,
sv,"I don't know what's causing society to have so many broken families and things like that, because I think that's bad for us.",,
aa,I do too.,,
sv,I think part of that,,
h,I don't know,,
sv(^q),"I think the role of women changing has been good in that women are feeling like, in terms of their self confid-, confidence, their self worth, you know, I can do something",,
^q,"I can be somebody, you know",,
^q,"if I put my mind to it, I can accomplish things too.",,
sv,And I think that's good,,
sv,"but, um, I think when you push, you know, maybe I think when that was first trying come about with, you know, what we know as the women's lib movement",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,I think it was too extreme.,,
sv,"Um, I think you can be feminine and still be all those other things too, you know",,
sv,and I think there's definite roles,,
sv,"and I think, you know, part of the break up of the family, maybe it's because of the, the, the social changes",,
h,I don't know,,
sv,"the fact that, uh, during their early changes where, you know, women did come more, speak, maybe speak out, I was going to say, come more out of themselves",,
sv,but speak out,,
sv,I think a lot of men were threatened by that.,,
sv,"I think now less men are, you know, because they're used to it",,
sv,it's around them.,,
h,"Um, but I, I don't know",,
sd,"I, I, I don't know why the families are breaking up.",,
sv,"I think that may go back to what you said a minute ago about people not being responsible for themselves or their actions, because it's like they don't go into the marriage with a commitment that this is going to work.",,
sd(^q),"They go in and say, well, hey, you know, I'll stick with it while it's good",,
^q,and then I'll get out.,,
sv,"And I, I, I think that directly affects the effort that you put into that marriage or that commitment.",,
aa,Yeah,,
aa,I would agree with you.,,

b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"But, um, one that, um, I thought was a problem that MUMBLEx, I thought it was a serious problem, that I'm not sure it's being taken care of right now, uh, was like bilingual education",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"for, um, different",,
+,"um, minority groups and like Asians and, um, uh, Mexican Americans and, and just people in general that speak other languages that sometimes come from other countries or coming from different areas and they, and in this area",,
sv,"and, um, as the school district, I'm not sure how to go about it, because it's hard to get one teacher that speaks all these languages",,
b,Right.,,
sd,"and so most of these children are put in, um, either special ed or a bilingual program, and then for just a small amount of time",,
sd,"and then they're into their regular classrooms the remaining of the, part of the day",,
sd,and so the teachers are not sure how to teach them math when they don't read or speak English.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And so, um, a lot of the money isn't put into that",,
sd,and so these children are just kind of sat in the corner,,
sv,"and, um, you know, there's only so long you can do that",,
o@,and,,
aa,Right.,,
+@,to me that seemed like a big problem in the school districts.,,
sd,And a lot of the teachers,,
sv,"it n-, it was not the teacher's fault.",,
sv,A lot of the teachers were just not getting the backbone or support that they needed or the materials or the extra help that they needed for these specific children MUMBLEx.,,
qy,"Do you find that those parents, um",,
sd,I've seen the same thing and heard the same things,,
sv,"and at the same time I've heard that it's even harder when both parents are required to work and can't spend, you know, that, that time, you know",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"typically the mother was at home with, uh, the children and",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,and at least could kind of keep up on what's going on,,
sv,"and really society sort of dictates that, uh, you know, both the parents work.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,"And, um, I know I've heard some people talk about just the fact that even as far back as the, you know, the second and third grade, uh, if the kids had, you know, proper reading skills or learned proper reading skills that, that would make a lot of difference.",,
aa,"Oh, yeah.",,
aa,"Oh, definitely",,

b,Yeah.,,

%,and,,
aa,"Oh, definitely",,
aa,yeah.,,
sv,"It, uh, makes it tough because MUMBLEx you know when they come in with scores that low, they may be, uh, good students",,
sv,but they just haven't achieved to their fullest potential,,
sv,and they're going,,
b,Yeah.,,

qh,so,,
aa,Right,,
aa,right.,,

b,Yeah.,,

sd,"Well, I know Richardson school district has a, has a wonderful program in the remedial reading, um, where, you know",,

sd,"and, and, uh, some children who need extra help are put into this, um, reading program",,
sd,and it is just excellent.,,
%,It is,,
b,Yeah,,
x,.,,

b,right.,,

sd,"We had, you know, had shotguns for, for quail and pheasant hunting and things like that.",,

sd,"we had to do that until we finally got the house paid for and, and other big bills taken care of.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"Uh, we have a, a budget",,

b,Yeah.,,
sd,"So it, it's, uh, it's helpful.",,
ny,"I mean, yes",,
sd^e,"having a budget is very, very important",,
sd,"and that did get us so that, you know, the house is paid for and, uh, other major things are taken care of",,

b,Sure,,
b,uh-huh.,,
+,we just spend about so much.,,

b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,A certain amount.,,
sd,"I think I've, I do that automatically myself.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"I mean, I unconsciously, uh, you know, stay in a, within a, with a certain amount because I, I have enough food already stored here",,
b,Oh.,,
+,that I don't have to make any large purchase at any one time.,,
sd,All I normally do now is pick up little things here and there. If the salt goes out or we need sugar or something like that.,,
ba,Wow,,
ba,that's great.,,
b,Yeah,,
sd,we have two freezers,,
sd,"and, course, we have a large garden here that we grow a lot of our own stuff",,
sd,and we freeze a lot of that,,
sd,so a lot of the vegetables are taken care of in our own,,
b,Oh.,,

sv,"Oh, you guys sound pretty self sufficient.",,
sd,"Well, we, we keep a little note pad on a, on a wall.",,
%,W-,,
sd,"if anything is absolutely out, make a note of it",,
sd,"and then, uh, the next time I go to the store, why, I pick it up and fill it up.",,
b,Huh.,,
sd,"So it's, it's worked very well that way.",,

sd,"Uh, the other person might not know about it.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,That way we,,
ba,"Well, that's a good idea.",,
+,keep up to date.,,
^h,Let's see,,
sd^t,"the other thing there the topic was talking about was, if, if, uh",,
qh,"all I can think of is if you don't keep a real, a real tight budget, how do you control expenses",,
%,"but, uh, one",,
sd,another thing that we do is we always fly back to California and Washington each Christmas.,,
sd,"Well, not fly back",,
sd,but somehow we get back there.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And, uh, this year we did it by train because it was the least expensive",,
%,and,,
sd,"Well, actually, it's more interesting, too, if you've",,
br,Huh ?,,
+,got the time.,,
b,"Oh, yeah.",,
sd,"And, uh, you know, we could go to both places without having to spend so much for",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,plane fare.,,
sd@,"And so, uh, we find that if we're careful with our, you know, just everyday things like grocery shopping and, and gas and entertainment, things like that, then, uh, somewhere in, out in the wash, it will come out that we have enough to get back there.",,
b,Sure.,,
+@,You know.,,
sd,"Well, I think we unconsciously do the same thing.",,
fa,"Excuse me, my throat's not as clear today as it should be.",,
b,Uh-huh,,
bd,that's all right.,,
sd,"Uh, we are, uh, going to be traveling to Europe with a choral.",,
sd,We sing with a so called Pennsylvania choral,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"and we make a two weeks tour of, of, uh, foreign countries",,
sd,"and, of course, that costs money.",,
%,"So we, uh",,
sd,"each of us watches the funds that we spend and make sure that, that we gather together over a period a time enough money to, to make this trip.",,
sd,"So th-, that is another way of, uh, budgeting",,
aa,Uh-huh,,
aa,that's right.,,
sd,and I think we just sort of unconsciously do it.,,
sd,"We, uh, just live a normal life",,
sd,"but we don't throw any money away, particularly.",,
sd,"We save it for this trip, which is, uh, always very, very nice.",,
b,Yeah,,
%,"well, whenever",,
sd^t,I don't know if this is part of the topic,,
sd,"but whenever I find, you know, a dime or something on the ground, I, I'll probably pick it up.",,
aa,I do the same thing.,,
sd,I have a whole pile of them saved that I have found by parking meters.,,
b,Uh-huh,,
%,yeah,,
sd,I have a special little jar that I keep all the money I found in.,,
sd,"You know, just",,
b,Yeah.,,

b,Yeah,,
x,.,,
b,"But, yeah.",,
ad,"Well, let's face it",,
sv,"the, when we're talking budget, it is important to, to have a budget",,
sd,"and, uh, I, I keep track of mine on a more rough basis now by just watching the level of my checking account",,
sd,and I have a money market account also.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And, uh, I keep those levels up above a certain minimum",,

qw,What sort of requirements to you have for your car ?,,

qy^d,"Top of, top of the line.",,

b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"it's real difficult to drive, reach over, and try to roll down the window.",,

b,Uh-huh,,
b^r,uh-huh.,,
qo,What about you ?,,
sd,"Well, I guess I'm, uh, more traditional in that I don't like p-, power windows or power locks",,

b,Oh.,,

aa,Right,,
sv,that's a good idea.,,

qr,"But, uh, you think you'd buy, uh, an American car or a European or Japanese ?",,
sd,"Well, I, actually I don't know a lot about different brands.",,
sd,"I tend to have, you know, my requirements like the last time I bought a car I, I guess I did sort of prefer American",,
sd,"and my requirements were basically, you know, good repair record, good mileage, uh",,
sd,and I needed air-conditioning,,
sd,"and, uh, can't remember what my, oh",,
sd,"I wanted s-, uh, stick shift. And, so I didn't have a whole lot of choice.",,
sd,"There was one car in all of the, the metropolitan area that I could find that, you know, was sort of a medium priced car with a stick shift in it.",,
qw,What was that ?,,

b,Huh,,
b^m,stick shift,,
^g,huh ?,,
ny,Yeah.,,
qr,"Did it have, what, a three speed or a four speed ?",,
nn,No,,
sd^e,a five speed.,,

sd,and so it had been on the lot three months,,
sd,and they were really eager to sell it.,,
ba,Wow.,,
sv,"So, I guess in this area, at least, you know, if it's not automatic, it doesn't move.",,

%,"and, what, I'm, I'm curious.",,
sd,"I, I know why I love a stick shift.",,
qw,"Why d-, why did you want one ?",,
sd,"Well, I just wanted it because, again, I had, I guess traditionally always had a car that had one",,
sv,and I thought it would be more reliable.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
b,Uh,,
sv,It's hard to find stick shift cars anymore.,,
aa,I found that out.,,
sd,"I mean, you know, the people would just sort of look at me like, you must be crazy when I",,

%,so,,
b,Huh,,
%,yeah.,,
%,So,,
nn,No,,
sd^e,I mean most of the sports cars are stick shift.,,

b,Huh.,,
sd,Not that I was looking for sports cars,,
sd,"but, now the people I've talked to don't seem to have stick shift.",,
b,Huh.,,
qw,And so why do you like stick shift ?,,
sd,"Uh, I guess I, I grew up on it and it's fun.",,
sd,"It's, it's an enjoyable part of driving.",,
sd,"I do feel like I have, uh, more control",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

b,Right.,,

sd,Uh there's not a whole lot of mountains here in Texas,,
aa,That's right.,,

sd,but hopefully I will be able to get back to the slopes some day,,

nn,No,,
sd^e,I never did.,,

sd,I couldn't go by myself.,,
aa,Yeah,,
aa,that's true.,,
aa,That's true.,,
sd,"And then of course, once I got to the age where I could have done it myself, I had other interests I guess.",,
%,So.,,
b,Oh yeah.,,
sd,I guess that for me it was very helpful.,,
sd,My two oldest brothers were very interested in skiing.,,
b,Oh yeah.,,
sd,"And so we, we went quite often",,

sd,When I lived around in that area my brother would fly in from Chicago,,
sd,and we would go skiing and enjoy that.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"So, but, uh, luckily it's kind of unusual because hobbies, it's a, it's a nice thing to have",,
sd,and it's good to fall back on those hobbies when you have time to. Like you mentioned,,
sd,"and I am finding out, a lot of the spare time that I had isn't there.",,
aa,That's right.,,
sd,"It's, uh, it's, uh, taken up by activities with, uh, work, with family, with, uh, civic and Church responsibilities for me.",,

sv,"I've had one idea that I think is, is, is completely undoable",,

sv,but I suspect it would work.,,

b,Um.,,

b,Yeah.,,

b,Yeah.,,

b,Yeah.,,
sd,"And my husband was in the type of business that, you know",,
sd,it's insurance,,
sd,so you have to build a clientele,,
sd,and by the time we had kids I couldn't quit.,,
ba,"Oh, boy.",,
sd,And so I haven't been able to quit yet.,,
sd,So I've had to deal a lot with child care,,
sd,"and course, we're hoping within, hopefully, the next two years I'll be able to quit and stay home.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"But, uh, I started out, uh",,
sd,my best friend kept my kids from the time my daughter was born,,
ba,"Oh, that's neat.",,

sd,and it worked out pretty good.,,

b,Yeah.,,

sd,"I put, uh, my oldest in a preschool program just for him to have the experience of",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,"and I had several friends who had, had recommended it, too.",,
sv,But it really gets down to the particular teacher.,,
b,Huh.,,
sd,And she was a new teacher at the school,,
sd,"and she had eleven, you know, three year olds in a room",,
sv,and I just think it was way too much.,,

qy,But she had no help ?,,

qy^r,She had no help ?,,
qy^d,She was alone with them.,,
na,I didn't think much.,,
na^r,I don't think much.,,
ba,"Oh, that is hard.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"And she was just my, uh",,
sd,three year old is real active.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,And she just kept saying how wild he was.,,
sd,"Well, you know, there was kind of a connotation there of him being, you know, it being a problem.",,
sd,Like he ran back from the bathroom singing and skipping she said.,,
sv,"Well, you know, at three years old",,
ba,Jeez.,,
+,I don't find that to be a behavioral problem.,,
aa,I don't either.,,
%,So.,,
+,You know.,,
sv,"I mean, it's kind of like she was, there was so much going on that she felt like she needed to control more",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,and it's really hard to con-,,
sv,"you can't control eleven three year olds with one person, you know.",,
^2,You have to let them have some wild time,,
aa,"Yeah, you know.",,
+,if that's considered wild.,,
sd,So I just finally took him out. Plus financial reasons.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,It was expensive.,,
sd,But I was real careful and visited and everything ahead of time.,,
sv,"But I still felt like even after all the checking I did, you know, you really can't know everything",,
x,MUMBLEx.,,
+,about what's going to happen.,,
sd,"I felt safe that the kids weren't going to be left alone somewhere in a room where a teacher could do something inappropriate with them, you know, because",,
b,Right.,,
+,there was enough classrooms close together that it was like a house with different classrooms.,,
sd,And I,,
b,Right.,,
+,felt like that was a big factor for me.,,
sd,That they would would be safe,,
b,Yes.,,
+,"you know, from any kind of abuse or that",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,kind of thing.,,
sd,"Well, when, when my friend decided to go back to work, and whenever we had problems, it worked out okay because she would come and tell me",,
sd,and we'd work it out.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"After that, I found another girl that had gone to church with us that, you know, they needed it financially.",,
sd,She had a little boy that was the same age as my little boy,,
%,and I though,,
sd(^q),"well, you know, we'll try her.",,
sd,But she came to our house,,
sd,and that just did not work.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"Uh, I mean, she loved the kids",,
sd,and she was good with them.,,
sd,"But, uh, you know, they were filthy when I'd get home.",,
sd,Now I understand kids go out and play,,

b,Yeah.,,
sd,but I mean filthy.,,
sd,I'm talking sand in the ears and the eyes and the hair,,
%,and the,,
ba,"Oh, gosh.",,

sd,"And then, you know, my own furniture and stuff was like, you know",,
sd,"the kitchen table, the, I'd find peanut butter and jelly all over the table and the chairs",,
%,and the,,
bf,You had to come home and clean before you could,,
sd,and clean,,
sd,and I was like,,
+,even do anything probably.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"And then, in the end, uh, she basically ended up stealing a hundred dollars from me",,
sd,"so I was, I had a pretty bad taste in my mouth.",,
sd,"She told me about five thirty one afternoon, it was a Friday, that she wasn't keeping kids anymore as of Monday morning.",,
ba,Oh gosh.,,
sd,"Well, you know, I work eight to five thirty",,
qh,so what am I supposed to do.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"So I, well, I had been sick",,
%,and I,,
sd,it ended up that I didn't go to work Monday because I was sick.,,
sd,So I stayed home with them,,
sd,and we went to some of the Kindercares.,,
b,"Oh, yeah.",,
sd,"I was, I took the kids there once just to try it.",,
sd,They had a free day at Kindercare.,,
b,Yeah.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"Well, that's what they said.",,
sd,There were two pretty near our house,,

b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,Wednesday I took them to one Kindercare.,,

b^m,They didn't give him.,,
sd,"And the other one was that the, the younger one got bit",,
b,Oh.,,
+,really badly by another child,,
sd@,and what they did was they took my younger one out and put him in a crib and left him in a crib the rest of the day.,,
ba,"Oh, that's horrible.",,
+@,Instead of taking the kid that was biting out and do something with him.,,
sd,And doing something with him.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"Well, not only was it going to cost me like a hundred and fifty dollars more a month, which I didn't have",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,"you know. I didn't, I, you know",,
sd,"we're, we're a Christian family",,
sd,"and, you know, they, because they're, you know, like public, they're not private",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,you know. They can't pray,,
sd,they can't talk about God.,,
sd,They can't do anything like that,,

b,yeah,,
b^r,yeah.,,
+,you know,,
sd(^q),"but I'd like them to be able to say, gee, God made the flowers, you know, and",,

bd,That's okay.,,
sd,I got the dryer going,,
b,Yeah.,,
+,in the background,,
%,so.,,
sd,I was only about twenty dollars more a month than I was paying because being a private institution they're nonprofit.,,
b,Yeah.,,

sd,"I told Russ yest-, that we should have done this a long time ago",,

b,Right.,,
sd,And I thought it was a good sacrifice to make,,

sd,though I would never even consider,,

sv,I I I think uh you,,

%,but I I still,,
sv,what the stan- flag stands for I guess to me is,,

b,uh,,
%,Now uh Well I I still,,
sd,Unless,,

aa,No,,
no,I don't know,,

b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,And Um I believe that the idea of burning,,
b,huh.,,

b,Yeah.,,

b,Uh-huh.,,
+,because they do want to be financially set up.,,
aa,Yeah,,
sv,"well, even to get school finished, I think",,
sv,a lot of times it's better if they do finish their schooling before they settle in.,,
sv,Because a marriage takes a lot of effort and concentration,,
sv,"and if you're busy with school it's, I think it's really difficult for a family.",,
aa,Right.,,
sv,"But probably, uh, you know, more women being in, in the work force also greatly, greatly affects social change.",,
aa,Uh-huh,,

fp,Hi.,,
qo,"Well, what do you think ?",,
sv,"Well, providing universal health care insurance for the whole country is a pretty big task",,
sd,"and I, uh, personally, I don't approve of it for two reasons.",,
sv,"Number one is that I think that, uh, the federal government has a problem with the deficit right now",,
sv,"and if they were to administer this, they would, uh, get us more and more into debt, further than we can ever get out ourselves.",,
sv,"Number two I think that the quality of health care would go down because the competition would, would be dried up",,
sv,"and really no one would be, would only answer to, to the government to a big bur-, bureaucratic mess.",,
sd,"And, uh, I've seen what it has done in other countries",,
sv,"and so I don't think, uh, I don't think we should head in that direction.",,
sv,Although that we have problems right now,,
aa,and I do agree that they exist,,
sv,"because health care insurance for, for everyone is skyrocketing",,
sv,and it's become to a point where basically no one can afford it anymore.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
qo,How do you feel about the whole ordeal ?,,
aa,"Well, I agree that it's a big task",,
sv,"but I think that, I think that the U S should move toward some kind of national health care plan. At least as a long term kind of goal.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"And possibly, y-, just starting with more regulation of health insurance and that sort of thing",,
sv,"but I think that ultimately it would be a good idea to, uh",,
sv,and not have a completely socialized,,
+,medical system,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"in the country, maybe something about halfway between that and what we have now.",,
bk,Okay.,,
sv,"It, uh, just because it seems that, uh, health insurance costs are sky rocketing, well, as fast as the national deficit",,
b,"Oh, yeah.",,
+,perhaps,,
%,and so that,,
sv,and,,
%,But what,,
+,that's a,,
%,What you're think,,
+,"that's a vicious cycle, of course.",,
+,Yeah,,
bf,so what you're,,
%,Because,,
+,"saying though, is instead of having the national government, uh, government administer, giving health insurance to every man, woman and child with, throughout",,
qy,Is that,,
b,Um,,
+,is that correct,,
qrr,or do you think that,,
nd,"Well, I, uh, well, I wouldn't exclude the possibility of the government actually administrating it ultimately.",,
sv,I don't think that that would necessarily be such a bad idea.,,
%,"And,, uh",,
qy,"Well, with the, with the costs as they are right now, do you think that the government, uh",,
sv,"because what that would require is for us to pay, uh, more taxes",,
sv,"and the, the in-, the people that can afford taxes, the middle income and the upper income will be paying more c-, taxes to, to pay for health insurance for everyone, whereas right now",,
b,Right.,,
+,"the, the public themselves get health insurance",,
sv,and they provide their own health insurance.,,
sv,"The, well, as it is now, the middle and upper classes are paying more than their share for the health care of the whole country because they're the only people that can afford health insurance",,
sv,and so that the other people have no health insurance,,
sv,"and, you know, they'll get medical care anyway at least in emergencies",,
sv,and,,
%,E-,,
+,somebody winds up paying for that,,
sv,and basically the people paying for it are the people who are buying health insurance,,
sv,"so I don't see that anything, that this situation would get any worse.",,
sv,That way it might get better.,,
qy^g,"You think it might b-, get better, huh ?",,
ar,"I, I kind of disagree.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
%,"The reason being is, uh, we have",,
h,I don't know,,
sv,"I guess it's my, my fear of the national government and also because the bureaucratic",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,rules that it would take to administer it,,
sv,"and, uh, the, the health insurance companies right now pretty much regulate and are pretty picky and, and, uh, don't allow cases where they might throw them out of business, whereas the federal government if they took over everything, they wouldn't care because they'll never go out of business.",,
sv,People would still have to pay taxes,,
sv,the money would have to come from somewhere,,
%,and so you'd s-,,
sv,"I, I feel that the cost would increase dramatically also.",,

b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,and sometimes I use the Miracle Whip.,,
+,The Miracle Whip.,,
sd,It depends on what I have.,,

b,Yeah.,,
sd,I like to make that too.,,

sv,And that is not too hard to do because you can do it in advanced and just bake it.,,
aa,"It is not really, once you have all the ingredients",,

b,Yeah.,,

sd,"Then, I have a wonderful recipe for strawberry pie.",,

qy,Do you make cheesecake ?,,
ny,"Uh, uh-huh.",,
sd^e,I do.,,
sd,"But this one is basically, it is like a normal pie crust.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"But then you use this sort of, uh",,

sd,"but you, use, uh, thin it out a little bit.",,
b,Uh.,,
+,"Uh, or make it a little fluffier",,

b,Uh-huh.,,

%,So,,
ba,"Well, I understand that.",,
sd,I have been trying to get myself motivated.,,
sd,"I had gone, gotten up regularly for awhile with a neighbor. Uh",,
sd,she had injured her back and needed a walking partner,,

sd,And I just don't like walking by myself at night or in the dark of the morning,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,I don't seem to find time in the day time.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"And of course, it is motivation that is keeping me from really looking for that opportunity.",,
sv,"I think a lot of the times, if you have someone to, uh, work out with, or walk with, or something, it does give you that motivation.",,
b,"Oh, yeah.",,
sv,"And you can also, I mean you can, you know, pretty much do it privately if you had your own private, uh, sort of contest. You know",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,where you would try and see if you could lose more weight than your friend or something like that.,,
aa,Yeah.,,
aa^r,Yeah.,,

%,"Well, more than weight",,
sd,"of course, I could lose, uh, lose certainly",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,from ten to twenty pounds,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,but I think more than that,,
sd,I also notice I just feel better when I exercise.,,
b,"Oh, yeah.",,
sd,And that is something that I am motivated about now because I do need to get myself feeling better,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,just in better shape.,,
sd,"But, uh, all the same it is connected to my attitude",,
sd,because I am not feeling as perky and good.,,
%,I am also,,

sv,perky is a good word for it,,
b,Yeah.,,

b,Yeah.,,
sv,"And I understand that walking is suppose to be the, like, the best exercise.",,
sv,Better than running.,,
aa,Yeah.,,
aa^r,Yeah.,,
sv,Things like that,,

aa,yeah,,
aa,it doesn't hurt you.,,

b,Yeah,,
x,.,,
sd,"You know, uh, there were points you could, you would make",,

sd,"So, I don't do",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"Well, I have got a dog now",,

%,and,,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,I know a lot of people just to be safe,,

b,Yeah.,,
ba,That is kind of an idea.,,

sd,that it is also for security as well as the convenience of doing it any time of the year.,,
b,Uh.,,

b,Oh.,,

ba,"Oh, that's good.",,
aa,Yeah,,
sd,so it's been good for our family.,,
qy,"Well, as a piano teacher, do you have any feelings for kids who come from a Suzuki method",,
qy,have you had any former Suzuki students ?,,
ng,I don't have any Suzuki students. Uh,,
qw^d,I was wondering how,,
sd,"Something happening to me at Christmas time that, that verified to me that I will al-",,
o,I'm ready.,,
ad^t,Why don't you go ahead and start off.,,
aa,Okay,,
sd,"well, I don't have an elderly person that I could send to a, a nursing home or anything.",,
sd,"My, both of my parents are dead",,
sd,"but I did have a friend that was in a convalescent home, uh, like a nursing home",,
sd,"and I h-, went there very often to visit her and, uh, made me feel really sad.",,
sd,"If I did have a mother living, I don't think I could do that.",,
sv,"I think they would be better off being at home with their family, you know.",,
aa,"I agree, although, we're in that situation right now.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"We have a, an eighty seven year old mother in law living with me right now",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,and because of her circumstances she can no longer live independently.,,
sd,And even moving from her house to our house,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,has been tremendously unsettling for her,,
sd,and we have several young children,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,and they about drive her crazy.,,
ba,"Oh, I can believe that.",,
%,Yes,,
sv,because most elderly people can't take having a lot of noise and kids running around and things like that.,,
sv,In a situation like that maybe it would be better.,,
sd,"Well, we've, you know, we've struggled a lot with it because, again, most of the nursing homes I've been in are very depressing to me.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,And she's still alert enough that I think she would really know that we were putting her there,,
b,"Oh, yeah.",,
sd,and I think she would really resent it,,
sd,and I think that would make it very hard.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"But, on the other hand, I see my wife with",,
sd,I guess our youngest one now is five,,
b,Oh.,,
sd,and her trying to struggle because her mother really can not take care of herself.,,
sd,She needs to be,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,bathed and dressed and a lot of those kinds of,,
b,Oh,,
+,things.,,
sv,"see, now that's, that's, that's really a sad situation.",,
sv,And so the drain on the family.,,
aa,Yeah,,
aa,"really, you know.",,
sd(^q),"And when the kids have kids come, you know, she's always saying, you know, why do they have to be here",,
^q,why can't they send them home,,
^q,it's too noisy,,
sd,and,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,she'll say that to the kids' friends.,,
b,Yeah,,
b,right,,
b^r,right.,,
sv,"So it's a hard situation, either way, I think.",,
aa,Yeah,,
sv,"in a case like that, you know, you more or less think it would be better if she were in a nursing home because you have your family growing up where",,
sd,I think that's one of the things we're really wrestling with.,,
qh,When does it become detrimental to our family to the point that you have to consider that,,
b,Uh-huh,,
b^r,uh-huh.,,
+,as opposed to considering her current circumstances,,
%,and,,
aa,Uh-huh,,
sv,but the cost of these nursing homes are so,,
^2,"Oh, prohibitive.",,
+,You know,,
sv,a lot of people can't afford that.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,"You know, so you really have no choice that way if you, you know, if you're not rich or s-, you know.",,
sd,"Uh, I know this lady that, you know, that was a friend of mine",,
sd,"now her husband was still alive at the time when she was in there, you know",,
sd,and it was costing him a small fortune to keep her in there.,,
b,Yeah.,,
%,So,,
sv,I think we need to develop some alternatives like adult day care,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"that's more readily available, you know",,
sv,I think if we could send her someplace for the day,,
b,Yeah,,
^2,then bring her back home at night.,,
+,and she could be around some elderly people and have some activities would be of more interest to her,,
aa,Uh-huh,,
aa^r,uh-huh.,,
+,and then in the evening have her return and be with the family.,,
aa,Yeah,,
sv,"you know, just come home for dinner",,
sv,and then usually they want to go to bed fairly early anyhow.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,"You know, so that would probably be nice if we could ever get something like that",,
%,but,,
sv,But there's not many of those available right now,,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,and they're very hard to get them into,,
sd,and,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,we tried sending her to a senior citizen center.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,But they're really not prepared to cope with her because she's somewhat senile.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And so a lot of the activities that they're engaged in, she can't participate in.",,
b,Uh-huh,,
b^r,uh-huh,,
b,um.,,
sv,"But I think it's an issue that, you know",,
sv,"with the graying of America, we're really going to have to, as a, as a country figure out how we're going to deal with this.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,Because it is a difficult situation,,
sv,"and, you know, you hate seeing them just, sort of send off and not well cared for.",,
aa,Yeah,,
sv,if,,
%,And yet,,
+,"if they don't know anybody and they don't know what's going on around them and everything like that, well, I can see, maybe a nursing home",,
sv,"But if they, they have their wits about them and everything, why, it's kind of hard.",,
sv,"And then I think it depends on their physical ability, too, you know",,
sv,if they could be up and doing some things,,
aa,Uh-huh,,
aa^r,uh-huh.,,
+,it might be better than when they're just sort of needing almost constant supervision and care.,,
aa,Uh-huh,,
aa^r,uh-huh.,,
sd,"Well, uh, my mother always said she hopes she never had to be like that",,
sd,"and, uh, luckily, I mean, she lived by herself",,
sd,"and then, you know, one day she had a heart attack",,
sd,and she was gone,,
sd,so she never did have to go into a nursing home or anything like that,,
sd,"but there's, so many of us kids, there was like seven of us that, my, we wouldn't have probably allowed that to happen anyhow.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"You know, she could have taken turns living with each one of us, you know, for a sh-, a sh-, a period of time because we all don't live in the same city anyhow, o-, nor the same state",,
%,so,,
qy,Do you live at all close to each other ?,,
no,"Uh, I, I have a couple more that live out here in California",,
sd,but then I have a broth-,,
ad^t,"Uh, why don't you go ahead first.",,
aa,Okay.,,
sd,"Uh, short term, uh, it works out pretty well because we have just enough to cover expenses with a little left over",,
sd,"so budgeting in the short term isn't too much of an issue because there's not that much, uh",,
b,Sure.,,
+,extra to go around.,,
sd,"Uh, long term is something we're starting to think about because our older child will be ready for college in about, uh, gee",,
sd,she's eight now,,
sd,so I guess about ten years.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
fe,Good heavens.,,
sd,"So we're, we're starting to think about long term considerations. College and retirement.",,
sd,"But with not a whole lot of discretionary money, it's kind of hard to figure out how to do it.",,
b,Sure.,,
qo,How about you ?,,
%,"That's kind of, uh",,
sd,"to what we're doing is budgeting, you know.",,
sd,"Month to month is, uh, kind of taking into consideration what the bills are and what's extra",,
sd,"so that's kind of how we do it, uh, from month to month depending on what insurance is due or whatever.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"Uh, long term, that's a little bit easier for us because, uh, with our jobs we can take out extra money towards savings, Four Oh One K plans",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"uh, that kind of, you know, retirement plans, that kind of stuff",,
sd,so we can kind of put aside some money that actually is better for us not to see,,
b,Right.,,
+,versus when it's on the paycheck,,
sv,and you have to try and take out some of that money.,,
sv,You always find something a little extra that you'd like to get that month,,
sv,"so, uh, long term probably is a little bit better than short term simply because, uh, it's automatically taken out.",,
sd,"So, uh, that works out much better for us",,
sd,so that's kind of how we do it anyway,,
%,but,,
sv,"And the old, uh, if you can't see it, then you can't spend it, uh, idea.",,
aa,"E-, exactly",,
sv,"and if you can't touch it, you can't spend it either.",,
sv,"So that kind of works out where you get into, uh, some plans that, you know, you touch it you're going to get a penalty, that kind of thing",,
sv(^q),so it leads you to kind of say well I'm not going to take it out.,,
^q,"I'm going to keep it and, uh, keep it in there and let it grow so that someway, maybe for retirement you're going to have that money",,
+,left.,,
sv,Let's hope anyway,,
sv,so,,
b,Right.,,
+,you'll have that,,
sd,so that's kind of how we do it.,,
sd,"But ours is more like month to month too, uh",,
sd,"short term is, to get things going",,
sd,"so. Anyway, other than that, uh, is kind of how we do it",,
qy^d^t,so. I don't,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"know if we're, our time is up or what.",,
%,"Uh, they'll, uh",,
qy^d^t,They'll let us know.,,
ny,Yeah,,
sd^e,exactly.,,
sd,"We, we actually do have some money in a Four Oh One K.",,
sd,I just,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"wish I could afford to, uh, put more away each week because I agree that it's a, an excellent way",,
aa,"Oh, definitely",,
aa^r,definitely.,,
sv,"And, uh, it grows, uh",,
sv,"it, it seems like at first you're not going to see a big return",,
sv,"but as the years go on, if you're with the company for any length of time then it gets much better",,
sv,"and, uh",,
+,"so, you know, you just have to kind of look at it that way",,
sd,and there's other savings plans or other things that you can do.,,
sd,"Automatic, you know, deposit from checks to where you don't see it.",,
b,Right.,,
sd,"And, uh, you know, exactly whatever is in our checking account is basically just about what gets spent.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,It's put into our savings account,,
sd,and we don't see it,,
sv,"then it works out to where, you know, you don't look at it",,
sv(^q),you just look at the checking account,,
+,and say this is what we have for money,,
sv,and that's it,,
%,so.,,
b,Yeah,,
sv,checking account's a very dangerous place for money to be I'm convinced.,,
aa,Yeah,,
sv,"it, it's easy because you do spend it",,
ba,that's for sure.,,
sv,"Like I said, you know, you kind of look at it, uh",,
sv,"you better have some other way of, uh, savings",,
sv,"otherwise, uh, checking accounts aren't the best for, you know, long term type of planning",,
sv,so. And you don't get a good return on it anyway,,
%,"so, other",,
aa,Yeah,,
sv,"I guess there, other than things like the stock market or mutual funds, there's really not much of a return on anything these days.",,
aa,Exactly.,,
aa,Right now.,,
aa,Yeah,,
sv,"it's a bad time, you know.",,
aa,Yeah,,
sv,the interest is so low.,,
sv,"I mean it, it's nice for people buying homes",,
sv,but,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,for older people who have money,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"in C D -s or whatever, it must be awfully hard to see rates go down to three and a half percent or whatever.",,
aa,Exactly,,
aa^r,exactly.,,
sd,"You know, we have some in-laws, uh, that, uh, had theirs in some money market certificates and other things and, uh, kind of took them out of that because they got so low",,
%,"but, uh",,
%,yeah,,
sv,"it's, it drops",,
sv,"so your better bet is to, uh, try to get in with something with your corporation if they have some kind of, uh, savings plans or something like that to where they kind of match the percentage or whatever so or some kind of profit sharing",,
%,so.,,
aa,Yeah,,
sd,"I'm, I'm with a small company now",,
sd,"and I hope that, uh, if we're successful that they'll go in for some sort of profit sharing",,
b,Sure.,,
ba,that'll be very nice.,,
aa,Yeah,,
ba,that's great,,
aa^r,yeah.,,
%,Okay.,,
sv^t,Well I guess we're kind of running out of steam on this topic here.,,
aa,Yeah,,
aa,exactly.,,
o,Okay.,,
sd,"Well, uh, just briefly.",,
sd,"Uh, I worked in a nursing home",,
sd,"so I kind of know, from way back, uh, how things used to be run",,
sv,and I think there has been definite changes of nursing homes,,
sd,"but I think, uh, if I had to personally put one of my parents in a nursing home, they would have to be pretty bad off to where I couldn't take care of them at all.",,
sd,"It would be something that, you know, I would certainly",,
sd,"if they're forgetting things or whatever, I'd prefer to have them at home or have them in what they call now home care",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,where somebody comes in,,
sd,and they cook meals,,
sd,and they clean their house for them,,
sd,that kind of thing,,
sd,so they still have their own independence,,
sd,"and not reliable, you know",,
sd,they don't have to be in a nursing home situation.,,
%,"But, uh, I don't think",,
sd,"the nursing homes, when I was working in them, were very much understaffed, very much, uh, in need of good personnel. Uh",,
sd,I think the patients weren't given the quality of care that,,
sd,"I wouldn't have, you know",,
sd(^q),I look at it and say thank God,,
^q,I got out of that kind of situation.,,
sd,But,,
b,Yeah.,,
+,"they, they were not given the time",,
sd,"and they were not given the money, basically, to staff, appropriately, people to help.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And I can remember lifting a patient all by myself, simply because there was not another person to help.",,
sd,"It's either le-, leave the patient in bed all day long or get them up",,
sd,and I would have preferred to get them up than to leave them in bed all day.,,
sv,"But, uh, uh, so I think nursing homes are, have changed.",,
h,I'm not quite sure,,
sv,"but hopefully, they have.",,
b,Yeah,,
sd,"wel-, th-, I guess I haven't had that much experience.",,
sd,I've only seen like my great grandparents in a nursing home,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,but,,
b,Yeah.,,
+,I have an aunt who lived on her own until she was well in her nineties,,
b,Sure.,,
sd,"and then she, she got sick",,
sd,and she ended up in nursing home,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,and my parents went to visit her,,
sd,"and it got to the point where the nur-, it seemed like the nursing home didn't want to deal wi-, her anymore",,
b,Sure.,,
sd,and so they gave her drugs to keep her asleep.,,
aa,Yeah.,,
aa,"I, I think that's, that can happen",,
sd,and I think in the nursing home that I worked for,,
sd,I wasn't quite sure of it,,
sd,"but I'm sure that some of the patients were, uh, given medication to keep them in, uh, quiet",,
%,"and, and",,
sv,Nice sedative state.,,
aa,Yeah,,
aa^r,yeah.,,
sd,And they would just lay all day long,,
%,"and, uh, the ones tha-",,
sd,they also put mentally ill patients in the same,,
sd,"they were not on the same, you know, ward",,
sd,"but they, they were in the same nursing home",,
sd,"so that these mentally ill patients could walk into where the other, uh, older people that were in there for reasons of, uh, you know age, uh",,
sd,"the mentally ill patients could walk right in, into the rooms or do whatever they wanted to basically.",,
sd,"Because if you weren't there to watch them and keep them in their own wing, they could, they had freedom to just walk around",,
sd,"and a lot of them were, I think there was a couple that were schizophrenic",,
sd,"and I remember one time watching one of the, uh, schizophrenic patients actually go out on, I don't know what they call it, a binge or whatever you want to say it",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,she grabbed a hold of this,,
sd,and it was kind of funny when I looked back at it,,
sd,"but, I mean, I remember the patient getting very upset.",,
sd,"That woman actually pulled, uh, the other person's hair.",,
sd,"I mean she just came up right behind him and pulled his hair, you know",,
sd,and it was a guy that was just really upset.,,
sd(^q),"I mean he said what the hell are you think you're doing, you know",,
sd,and I laughed at it then,,
sd(^q),"but then I'm thinking God, you know",,
^q,"if I had to put my parents in that nursing home, I wouldn't want them there.",,
sd,So,,
b,Yeah.,,
+,I think there's laws now that kind of protect. That nursing homes either have to keep the mentally ill totally away from these people and not in the,,
sv,"even though they're aging mentally ill, they are still mentally ill",,
sv,"and a lot of these older people have their, you know, they're not insane or anything like that.",,
sv,"They don't have these tendencies to, to lash out.",,
sv,To be violent.,,
sd,But seeing that kind of made me think twice about,,
fe,jeez,,
sd,"I wouldn't put my mother, father in that nursing home at all.",,
qr,Was this in a big town or a little town ?,,
sd,A small town.,,
bh,"Oh, really ?",,
ny,Yeah,,
ny^r,yeah.,,
sv,"Because it seems like the small town nursing homes, there's a",,
am,I don't know.,,
+,lot more personal attention.,,
am^r,I don't know.,,
sd,"I, I kind of look at it this way.",,
sv,"I think if you have a big city area, I think there's more people to keep watch on it.",,
aa,Uh-huh.,,
bf,You have,,
%,And,,
+,more options.,,
aa,Yeah,,
aa^r,yeah.,,
sv,And you have more competition.,,
sv,And I think nursing homes have to be better than when there's one nursing home for a whole community.,,
sd,And this is back in nineteen seventy-seven that I worked there,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd(^q),"and I look back at it and say jeez, you know",,
^q,"i-, it would have to be awfully bad for me to put my parents in there.",,
sd,"But my grandmother, uh, later on got cancer and, uh, could no longer",,
sd,well actually she,,
o,"Uh, taxes.",,
qy,Do you want to go ahead ?,,
na,Sure.,,

b,Uh-huh.,,
+,it's just,,
aa,I agree.,,
+,"I don't know, it ju-, just seems too much of the money is just lost.",,
aa,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"Well I think, uh, you know, when I look at, uh, all the things that are coming out now about over spending and spending money that's not there and buying things that are extremely expensive where they could buy it at a, at a better discount, uh",,
%,"when you, when",,
b,Um.,,
qy,"You mean like those, you know, twenty thousand dollar toilets ?",,
na,Exactly,,
na^r,exactly.,,
sv,"That's exactly, uh, the whole thing.",,
sv,When you take a look at all those issues of where our money is going,,
%,and it's just,,
sv,"as long as the person that's spending the money, uh, doesn't think about",,
^q,"oh, I can go out and spend anything that I want to",,
^q,it's just unlimited,,
aa,Sure,,
qy,it's real easy to spend other people's money.,,
^g,Right ?,,
na^m,Right.,,
sv,An unlimited source,,
sv(^q),"so they, they think well I'll go out and buy a four hundred toilet seat",,
sd,"and I could have went to K-Mart and bought it for, you know, ten or fifteen.",,
sv,"I mean, that kind of thing",,
%,"and, uh",,
aa,Right.,,
sd,"E-, I don't mind them getting what they need.",,
sd,It's just when they pay so much for it.,,
aa,Exactly.,,
sv,"It takes you know, very little to just shop around and",,
aa,Exactly.,,
sv,"And I know a lot of, uh, corporations now are looking at their amount of money that's being spent",,
sv,and they're looking,,
aa,That's true.,,
+,at what's the best buy.,,
sv,"It used to be you could go, if you had a company you had to go through certain people",,
sv,and you didn't care what you paid.,,
b,Yep.,,
sv,I mean you just got it done.,,
sv,Now people are putting in bids for things and are looking at things.,,
sv,"Going to actually shop at Best Buy for, Best Buy is one of our electronic stores",,
b,Right.,,
+,"for fax machines, things like that, instead of going through these office supply companies that mark up their amounts and say, you know, I'll give",,
sv,"and you can go to another shop and get it for maybe sixty cents or nin-, or ninety cents",,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,that kind of thing,,
%,so.,,
qh,I'm also wondering why our taxes are still so high considering like the world's probably in better shape now than it has been in the last fifty years.,,

sd,Let alone what I end up having to pay.,,
aa,Uh-huh.,,
aa,Exactly.,,
aa,Yeah,,
sv,that's the whole thing.,,
sv,Now they have gotten this wonderful idea of not taking out as much taxes,,
sv,but you're still going to owe the government as much money,,
b,Sure.,,
sv,"so by the end of this coming year, what's going to happen is all these people are going to find out that they owe the government",,
sv,"and it certainly isn't going to be in their savings, uh, account.",,
aa,Nope,,
sv,they won't be able to pay.,,
sv^m,They won't be able to pay it,,

aa,Sure,,
aa,none.,,

sd^t,feelings on what caused the S and L crisis,,
sd,I guess I don't have a real technical knowledge for what happened,,
sd,I gather that there where large numbers of situations where loans were made that appeared to be a good loan but in a speculative since,,
sd,"and with have little regulation going on because of deregulation during the Reagan eight years, uh, more and more S and L simply began to take riskier and riskier loans",,
sd,"and then when they began to collapse one after the other I think almost like an avalanche of, of property values devalued.",,
b,Uh-huh,,
bf,kind of like a domino's effect.,,
aa,Right.,,
sd,"I don't have a, a field for whether or not this is the equivalent of what was called the teapot dome.",,

nn,No.,,
+,from your histories lessons or whatever.,,
nn^r,No.,,
sd,"Uh, I vaguely recall",,
sd,but I've never gone and done any study on it since the S and L thing,,
sd,"that teapot dome scandal is when I think during the Hoover years where gobs of land was, was sold at really inflated prices on the theory that there were natural gas beneath it",,
sd,"and that, that appeared to be corruption within the Hoover administration.",,
sv,"I don't have a real since of, of like corruption that caused S and L all though I have a feeling that people look the other way when things began to go sourer maybe.",,
aa,Uh-huh.,,
aa,No,,
sv,I don't think it was really corruption that caused it,,
%,or within,,
sv,"I think people just started, you know, no-, not being as careful with the loans that they were making whenever, you know, whenever they gave them out.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,I think maybe they didn't check into them enough,,
sv,or maybe because everyone else was doing they figured they would just go ahead and approve it also,,
%,so.,,
b,Yeah.,,
b^m,Yeah.,,
sv,It seems like there were on awful a lot of people making loans and business decisions on a,,
sv,get rich quick is the wrong phrase,,
sv(^q),"but, if it captures some of the, the feeling I have from the people making business decisions that if they failed it's sort of well no skin of my back",,
^q,I'll move on to this other company,,

b,Uh-huh,,
x,.,,

qy^d,they just moved on.,,
no,I'm not sure.,,

b,Uh-huh.,,
+,whole thing.,,
sd,"I know, well, I'm, uh, I know a little bit about it",,
sd,but I don't as much as I should know about it,,
sd,I'm a finance major here at Clarion.,,
b,Okay.,,
sd,"And, um, I do know that one of the reasons that caused it is the fact that the federal reserved backed any loan that the Savings and L made with a, a hundred thousand dollars.",,
sd,So they were kind of insured with that hundred thousand dollars,,
sv,"and I think that's kind of why they, they were making the riskier loans",,
sv(^q),"because they were like oh, well, we have a hundred thousand dollars insurance on it.",,
qy^d,"Well, they didn't, they didn't have a since of risk.",,
nn,No,,
sd^e,I don't think so.,,
bk,"Oh, okay.",,
sd,"And, uh, plus where the fact where they were allowed to make loans in, any, almost any type of loan",,
sd,"and like some banks, you know, they're limited to the types of loans that they're allowed to make.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,And I think the S and L -s were more open with the types of loans that they were allowed to make.,,
bk,Okay.,,
sv,"And I think if they would be more bound to certain loans and not as high of insurance by the reserve, then I don't think this would have happened.",,
bk,Okay.,,
qy,"Well do you think we, there's a final accounting, yet not, in the since of pennies an nickels",,
qr,"but do you think there's accounting on an ordered of magnitude or, or that, that they really do understand how much money it is",,

b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"did, is your since that we now understand how bad it is",,
qrr,or is there more to be heard yet.,,
sv,"Um, I think that people just basically got tired of hearing it",,
sv,"and it wasn't making, it was wasn't as good news as it was.",,
sv,"I think it's still, you know, I adding up",,
sv,and I think it will be for awhile.,,
bf,So you don't think necessarily they don't have a complete grasp yet,,
aa,No.,,
%,or whether MUMBLEx.,,
aa,"I, I don't think they do.",,
sv,"I don't think how, I don't think how they could find that big, how much was really lost or how much they were going to lose, because there still are some S and Ls still open.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

qy,Do you think to possibly is that it will help with the regular banks ?,,

sv,but I think there are some regular banks that will go down with it.,,
sd,"It seems that I recall reading for the last oh, let's say starting three years a go but not so much in the last year of bank risks of relative to the loaning funds to third world countries like Mexico, Venezuela.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"Uh, and Argentina based on oil loans",,
sd,"and then the price of oil had, had gone south resulting in those loans being very risky",,
sd,and I guess I read articles of various banks that have done the right thing to contain their risks given that they had made multiple billion dollar loans.,,

sd,in some of my classes now I was just reading,,

sv,but it ended up protecting big investors.,,
b,Oh.,,

aa,Uh-huh.,,

aa,Right.,,
bf,"And given that the S and Ls have had disasters then those account holders are, are, their money is still being protected.",,
aa,Uh-huh.,,
bf,And that is it's million of people with anywhere from thousands to tens of thousands I guess of,,
aa,Uh-huh.,,

%,it's,,
sd,"if, if you take ten million people and protect ten thousand dollars it still only a hundred bi-, billion dollars",,
sd,and we're taking about monies way in access of that now,,
sv,so it's obvious that we've protected large accounts.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,And perhaps multiple people in multiple S and Ls,,
sv,"and, and it seems like maybe that needs to be thought about, rethought.",,
b,Yeah.,,
%,"You know that the, for",,
sd,"I guess I'm content with the need to have protection on, on accounts",,
sv,but I feel likes it's on an individual basis.,,
%,Someone whose got accounts in thirty-five different S and Ls or thirty or forty thousand dollars,,
sv,and they're all protected by the government.,,
sv,Seems to me like they've gotten around what was,,
+,intended to be the issue there.,,
b,Uh-huh,,
sd,I guess I don't have a personal since of V on it since I,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,was not a heavy user of any S and Ls,,
sd,"and, and let alone any of them that went bankrupt.",,
sv,And I guess that means that from my perspective it could happen again,,
aa,I think it could happen,,
sd,because that means,,
b,yeah,,
+,"I'm not worried enough, uh",,
sv,it's kind of thing where maybe we'll survive,,
sv,"and then I, then it will happen again because we don't pay attention to those kinds of things.",,
aa,I think it'll happen again,,
sv,but I think it will be a long time in the future before it does happen again.,,
sv,Because I think like the bank people in any kind of people like that are going to be worry enough not to let it happen again in the near future.,,
sv,But I think later on they're going to start and forget about and start making the riskier loans,,
sv,"because I mean, you're going to have to take some risk",,
sv,"and as long as they're backed I think they're still going, you know, start taking on riskier loans",,
sv,"and I think there is a chance of it possibly happen again but not until, you know, late, you know, in the future.",,
aa,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"Well, perhaps if there are regulatory, uh, constraints put back in place.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,It will protect that,,

sd,"and, but, I think, I mean, I don't enjoy paying taxes.",,
sv,And it's hard,,
sv,"but, um, I think that is what we have to have, you know, have our streets and have, have our government and. Excuse me. And have, and have the services that we need",,
sv,"and we have to pay for them and pay for the employment of the people that run them and, and things like that",,

b,"Yeah, um",,
sd,I actually hadn't heard anything about it,,
sd(^q),and some friends called up and said do you want to go see this movie,,
sd,"and, and they said it starred, um, Meryl Streep and Mel Brooks",,
sd,at first they told me.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd(^q),"And I thought, what a strange combination",,
^q,Mel Brooks and Meryl Streep.,,
aa,That is a strange combination.,,
sd,"Well, actually, it starred, that, that it's actually Albert Brooks",,
sv,so it's lot better.,,
qy^d,Mel Brooks you probably know.,,
ny,Yeah.,,
bk,I know,,
sv,"so it, it was a strange combination.",,
sd,But it turned out to be a very cute movie.,,
sd,"I mean, the whole premise is that they go out",,
sd,"and, and they die",,
b,"Oh, yeah.",,
sd,and they have to,,
qy^d,Both of them.,,
na,Right.,,
sd,Both of them are dead,,
sd,"and they happen to meet in this, this town, um, this, this sort of city where you're set up.",,
sd,"You know, they go",,
sd,and they decide if you can move up to the next level.,,
b,Oh.,,
qy^d,I don't know if you've ever read Jonathan Livingston Seagull,,
sd,but,,
ny,Yeah,,
sd^e,years ago.,,

sd,They sort of move up to levels,,
sd,"and, and they have to decide whether or not they're good enough",,
sd,"and as it turns out, you know, they meet there and fall in love and stuff like that.",,
b,Oh.,,
ad,So you can guess the rest of the plot.,,
sd,"It actually, it's, it's really funny because they run through, you know, what they have them do is sit down and see scenes of their lives.",,
b,"Oh, yeah.",,
qy^d,And then defend it.,,
sd,And that's pretty good actually.,,
qy^d,"Well, I guess that's where the title comes from then.",,
ny,Yeah.,,
sd^e,And it's MUMBLEx,,
sd,you actually have to go up there,,
sd,"and you have a, they have an attorney for, you know, attorney for you and attorney",,
sd,a defense and a prosecution,,
sd,"and you know, the prosecutor's job is to make sure you don't move up a level",,
sd,"and the defense's job is to make sure that you, you do, you know.",,
sd,"It's, uh, it's a neat little story actually.",,
aa,Yeah,,
aa,it is.,,
sd(^q),"I was, I was, I went thinking it'll be okay, not great",,
sd(^q),and then I actually came away thinking it was really pretty good.,,
%,So,,
ba,It's funny,,
sd,"we've got a couple of movies out recently, GHOSTS and DEFENDING YOUR LIFE, that have to do with, uh, after life, I guess.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,And it kind of makes you wonder,,
sd,"I'm also, besides working at T I, I'm a graduate student at North Texas and working on master's in communication.",,
sd,It's the behavioral science part of communication,,
sd,and I think about these things and people trying to define their own world view,,
qh,"and, uh",,
b,Um.,,

qh,or why are we so fascinated with the other world.,,
qh,Is it supposed to be better ?,,
b,The other world,,
%,yeah.,,

sv,We like those things that way.,,
%,"Um, I'm, I'm sure that it seems like",,
sv,"it certainly would, would explain the preoccupation with MUMBLEx",,
sv,but I suspect it's always been a preoccupation with that sort of things.,,
aa,"Well, it has.",,
sv,"All the way through history, there's, I guess",,
sv,if you want to call its mysticism or the occult or whatever. It's always fascinated.,,
sv,I guess because we don't know,,
sv,and there's no real way of finding out.,,
aa,Right,,
%,well.,,
sv,There's only one way of finding it.,,
qy,"Well did you ever see, um, FLATLINERS.",,
nn,No,,
sd^e,"I did, uh, did not.",,

sd,"it's on video now, I think.",,
aa,Yeah,,
aa,it is.,,
sv,"Probably, probably worth seeing on video.",,
sd,Actually we really enjoyed it,,
sd,but it was also right along the same lines.,,
sd,I mean,,
b,Yeah.,,
+,"they, they would go ahead and kill themselves for three or four minutes to see what happens.",,
b,Yeah,,
sd,"they said, she said that this was almost believable",,
sd,that could really happen.,,
sv,"You know, you get the medical profession doing these kinds of things",,
sv,and you never know.,,
aa,Almost,,
aa,yeah,,
sv,"I, I, it's a little far fetched to",,
+,find a bunch of medical students doing it,,
sd,but,,
b,Yeah.,,
+,"but, it was, um, it was, it was odd enough, you know",,
sd,and they didn't just sort of make it silly.,,
sd,"It was, you know, it was done fairly well, I think.",,
sd,"So. Actually, I actually enjoyed that as well.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,I like it when they will do something and not get too silly.,,
sd,"I've been disappointed in some movies that, they don't know how to end it, it seems like",,
sd,so then they get crazy,,

b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,"but, I appreciate more what I had.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,And I had all these classes and all this knowledge and this big library across the street from my dorm,,
b,Yeah,,
qy,were you at Baylor ?,,

b,Right.,,
sd,I graduated from Texas Tech,,

b,Right,,
b,yeah,,

sd,"the informal classes that you don't get credit for, you know ...",,

h,I don't know,,
sv,I guess you would consider that a home repair.,,
b,Huh-uh.,,

qw,What is your most recent,,
sd,"We just MUMBLEx did that, too.",,
qy^g,"You did that recently too, uh, ?",,
ny,Yes.,,
qy,Does it make a big difference ?,,
ny,"Oh, yes",,
sd^e,we have brick on the outside,,

b,Huh-uh.,,
sd,Completely.,,
qy^g,That's neat isn't it.,,
ny,Yeah.,,
sd^e,That was really exciting.,,
sd,It was fun.,,

sd,We're not quite through,,
sd,"but it's, it really is looking good.",,
sd,"Uh, we went through a process of, of, uh, home repairs on a, on a rental house we had",,
sd,"probably the most extensive and, uh, the interesting part of it was how much we learned about what we could do.",,
sd,"Um, we didn't have very much money",,
sd,and so we had to do it ourselves in kind of a slow process,,
sd,"but we learned how to do, uh, retile bathtubs and, uh, oh, just all kinds of things that are unusual.",,
b,Huh-uh.,,
sd,So the other thing that we did was the roof of our house.,,
b,Huh-uh.,,
sd,"And, uh, we did that a different color also.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"Of course, uh, being a woman most of these things were done by the men.",,
b,Huh-uh.,,
sd,"And, uh, so I wasn't directly involved",,

qy^g,"It's nice to not have a drip through from the roof, isn't it.",,
ny,Yeah.,,
ny,Yes.,,
ba,That's awful.,,
sd,"Um, Howard and I were talking about home repair the other night and, uh, in connection with scouting.",,
sd,We've got a scout coming up,,
sv,"and, uh, uh, I think it's neat for young people to learn how to, uh, take care of their, of a household, you know, like, uh, fixing faucets, dripping faucets",,
b,Huh-uh.,,
+,and putting in panes of glass and stuff like that.,,
sd,"As a matter of fact, one thing, I have a young son",,
sd,"and one thing we did, was we had paneling on the inside of our, uh, front of our house, or the hall way of our house, rather",,
sd,"and we were repainting the, the front room in the hall there",,
sd,and we took down that paneling,,
sd,and he helped me,,
sd,"and, and, uh, he was, it was fun to work with him.",,
b,Huh-uh.,,

qw,How does the paneling,,
qy^d,it looks lots better than,,
qy,do you like it better ?,,
na,"Oh, I like it so much better.",,

b,Yeah.,,

aa,Yeah.,,
aa,Exactly.,,
sd,"Well, we have a lot that needs be done.",,
sd,"We have, uh, uh, carpeting",,
sd,"and, and we did have a new, uh, floor put in our kitchen.",,
sd,"And, um, I have my mother living with us",,
sd,and so she was in a room with a carpet,,
sd,"and, of course, she's quite aged",,
sd,she's ninety-three now,,
sd,so that meant she had problems now and then,,
sd,and it was really good to get the carpet out of there and put a linoleum down.,,
sd,So it was easier to clean and see where the dirt was,,
sd,and,,
b,Huh-uh.,,
+,"so that was a really positive, uh, uh",,
sd,it was fairly expensive though.,,
sd,"I, I was impressed",,
%,"I think, that, uh",,
sd,we had somebody do it,,
sv,"and it was, it seems to me like it's probably more expensive to put down linoleum almost than it is to put down carpet.",,
b,Huh-uh.,,
sv,"Kind of depends on the quality of carpet, I suppose",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"but, uh, in the case of the linoleum they have to rip up everything and, and fix the floor",,
%,"so it's, uh",,
h,I don't know,,
h,what ever,,
sd,but they have to put stuff on the floor,,
sd,"and it's, uh, kind of a process.",,
bf,"Well, it sounds like you have some pretty good experiences with, uh, with, uh, uh, home repair.",,

qo,what do you do with your credit cards ?,,
b,Oh.,,
sd,"Well, my husband and I have gotten into some, some problems with credit cards.",,
sd,We don't handle them very well.,,
sd,"We, we tend to run them up to the maximum and then ask for more.",,
ba,"Oh, jeez.",,
sd,"They, they're, they're really bad for us.",,
sd,"Um, matter of fact, we've gotten rid of all of our credit cards except for a MasterCard and a Visa",,
sd,and we pretty much keep those maxed out.,,
sd,"Oh, I was going to say that, that sounds like, like pretty many.",,
sd,But I see what you meant,,
bf,you had them for each of the individual stores.,,
aa,Yeah,,
sd,"we had cre-, I had probably twenty credit cards",,
b,Uh-huh,,
b^r,uh-huh.,,
+,for,,
sd,"I had, I had an American Express, American Express Gold, an Optima, all the different department stores, um, two Visas, two MasterCards.",,
ba,"Oh, gee.",,
sd,"I mean, I had",,
sd,"any time anybody would, you know, send me an application, you know, preapproved or whatever, I went, I took it",,
sd,and it really ended up getting us in some real serious trouble.,,
aa,"Oh, sure.",,
sv,"Um, because, see, the more credit cards you have, the more people offer them to you.",,
aa,Uh-huh,,
aa^r,uh-huh.,,
sv,"And the more you use them, the more they send them to you.",,
qy^g,"But each of these had an annual fee also, right.",,
na,Exactly.,,
sd,"The American Express was probably the worst, um, because with the Gold card",,
sd,I can't remember how much it was because I didn't even have it very long before I gave it up,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"but I know the Green card was like thirty-five, forty- five dollars a year.",,
b,Yeah,,
ar,forty five.,,
%,"Right, uh",,
%,I,,
sv,Which was a lot,,
sd,"because I mean, you had to pay it in full every month.",,
aa,"Exactly, you know",,
aa,"I, that's it",,
sd,I really resented the fact that they were charging me for cards,,
sd,"so I sent back all of mine, except the ones that were free.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And, um, then, then I also limited it to one of each, one MasterCard and one Visa",,
sd,"and here, most of the stores will accept those",,
sd,and actually I then got a Discover card since they pay you back.,,
b,Uh-huh,,
b,yeah,,
sd,I had a Discover,,
sd,"and that was one of the ones in the group that I ended up, um, closing.",,
sd,"Um, it really wasn't my choice, though.",,
sd,"I mean, I ended up having, I ended up actually losing my credit cards.",,
b,Oh.,,
sd,"Um, I ended up going through a credit counseling service",,
b,Uh-huh,,
b^r,uh-huh.,,
+,"um, because my husband and I just don't handle credit very well",,
b,Uh-huh,,
b,yeah.,,
sd,"and, um, when, when you do that, they automatically, once you start with their service, they close your accounts out.",,
b,"Oh, I see.",,
sd,"So, I'm still paying on all these accounts",,
sd,but my accounts are closed.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"So, and I would prefer to keep it that way.",,
sd,"Once we, once we're paid off",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"um, I would prefer just to have one MasterCard and one Visa",,
sd,and that's it.,,
b,Yeah,,
b^r,yeah.,,
sd,Actually I pay off my cards every month.,,
sd,Only once in my life have I not paid.,,
sv,"I think that's a really good way to handle it, because that way, if you, if you paid off every month, you never have to worry about, well, how much do I have to pay these guys, you know, this month, you know.",,
sv,"This, you buy what you can afford.",,
sv,I mean,,
b,Right.,,
+,if you handle it just like you would like a check or cash,,
aa,Uh-huh,,
aa^r,uh-huh.,,
+,it's a lot easier to keep it in check.,,
sd,"Well, and also in a sense, they're giving you a loan for a month",,
sd,so that,,
b,Yeah.,,
+,"you know, if I were smarter, I would have that same amount in savings and get the interest, which I don't",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

%,"but, but yeah",,
sd,"the, the thought of adding, you know, X percent to, to the price of what I buy",,
b,Yeah,,
sv,and I,,

b,Uh-huh,,
b^r,uh-huh.,,
sd,and we probably still have about another year to go,,
b,Uh-huh.,,

aa,That's right,,
aa^r,that's right.,,
aa,Yeah,,
aa^r,yeah,,
sd,"that, I would, that would be a very scary feeling for me to know that I was, you know, juggling payments to different people",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,"it's just, a mental concept that I have.",,
b,Yeah.,,

%,that I just.,,
sd,"Well, when you, when you're getting rid of the whole credit card cycle, and if you really get into the mind set, I got really good at juggling money and basically robbing Peter to pay Paul",,

b,Uh-huh,,
b^r,uh-huh.,,

b,Uh-huh.,,

sv,And then all of a sudden you look at the bill,,

b,Oh.,,
%,"But, uh, golf tended to be so-",,
sd,"I am not really deeply involved in any, following any of the sports.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,But golf was one that I developed a working knowledge of a lot of the golfers,,
sd,and therefore I enjoyed following those particular players.,,
b,Right,,
qy^d,more because of their personalities,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,than their sportsman.,,
nd,Well part of it was the personality and their sportsmanship.,,
sd,Another part of it was I'd pick one out that was different than what my husband was rooting for,,
sd,so,,
+,"you know, the competitor",,
sd,and I became involved in following his career.,,
b,Right.,,
sd,"And, uh, I know that, that my husband",,

b,Oh.,,
sd,And he thought he was spectacular.,,
sd(^q),"I said, Whoa.",,

b,Uh-huh.,,

b,Uh-huh.,,
qy,"Do you ever watch those where they just play for a certain amou-, you know",,
sd,for each hole they win they get the money,,
ny,Uh-huh.,,

sv,I think those are pretty exciting.,,
sd,"Well, I myself, really have not seen a whole lot of point to the game of golf.",,
sv,You hit a little ball,,
sv,you chase it,,
sv,you go find it,,
sv,and then you hit it again and lose it again.,,
aa,Uh-huh,,
aa,yeah.,,
sv,And I know the whole point is to get it in that little bitty hole,,
sv,but seems to me like if they made the hole bigger it'd be easier.,,
b,Oh really.,,
sd,I sometimes wonder why men like it so much because they get so frustrated,,
aa,"Oh, I know.",,

b,"Oh, yeah.",,

sd,My husband and his buddies are not very good.,,
sd,They play like maybe once a month or less,,
b,Uh-huh,,
b^r,uh-huh.,,

sd,and they think they're having a really good game.,,
b,"Oh, yeah.",,
%,So.,,
sd,"Well, my husband's average ran in the mid seventies",,
ba,Wow.,,
sv,so he wasn't bad.,,
aa,Yeah,,
ba,that is good.,,
sv,He was pretty good,,
sv,"but as far as influencing young people, I think that that is, uh, that is one of the sports that you can carry into old age.",,
sv,You can't play football at fifty-five.,,
b,Right.,,
sv,"But it is a good healthy, wholesome lifestyle, uh",,
sv,anything can be warped.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,"But I think that that is one of the sports that's a good healthy way to, to move into maturity",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,safely.,,
sv,Something to stay active at,,
aa,Uh-huh,,
aa^r,uh-huh.,,
+,for a long time.,,
aa,That's right,,
aa^r,that's right.,,
b,Yeah,,
b^r,yeah.,,
sv,"And a lot of seniors, a lot of elderly people don't even take up golf until they're, you know, in their later years.",,
aa,Yeah,,
sv,and they can still get good at it.,,
aa,That's right,,
aa^r,that's absolutely right.,,

sd,"Well, maybe that's what I'll do when I have time later on",,
b,Yeah,,
sv,when you're too old to do anything else,,
b,Yeah.,,

%,yeah.,,
sv,"But it's, it's also something that husband and wife can participate in",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"or, you can both enjoy the same sport and participate in separate circles.",,
ba,True.,,
sv,"You know, you can go to the country club together.",,
sv,You can play with your friends,,
sv,he can play with his friends,,
sv,but you've both been out and exercised,,
sv,and you have enjoyed the day.,,
aa,Right,,
aa,yeah.,,
sd,Or my favorite,,
sv,just ride around in the cart with him.,,
ba,You bet,,
sv,you get a lot of exercise that way.,,
sv,"Go somewhere really nice, like Hawaii, and just",,
aa,Uh-huh,,

+,"if they're not real good golfers, sometimes it is not fun to ride around and listen to their exclamations all day long.",,
aa,"Oh, yeah.",,
sd,But my husband's pretty tolerant,,
sd,so he's not too bad,,
b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,He's replaced almost as many clubs as he has balls.,,

ba,Gosh.,,
sd,Now my husband has a temper,,
sd,but he doesn't seem to show it on the golf course.,,

b,Uh-huh.,,

b,Uh-huh,,
b^r,uh-huh.,,

sv,"Well, one thing that is a, is a drawback about it, I think, is the cost.",,
aa,Yes.,,

sv,the equipment is very expensive,,

^q,"If you do, then we can go golf together.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
ba,"Oh, whoa",,
ba,great,,
sd,I get to walk all around a little green field all day.,,
sv,"But those kinds of things happen, though",,
sv,"you, you get a little taste of it",,

b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,Me either.,,
sd,"You know, I'm always the one that got hit by the bat in baseball",,

sd,"The one thing that is also detrimental as far I'm concerned, my skin is very fair",,

b,Right.,,
%,And I don't think the,,
o,Okay,,
qy,have you participated in anything like that ?,,
na,Well a little bit,,
sd,we mostly do our newspapers.,,

sd,and we take them to be recycled.,,
b,Uh-huh,,
sd,"uh, we, we have a pretty nice recycling center, uh, in our city now",,

sv,And a lot of people complain because it's really not convenient for them.,,
aa,Yeah.,,
aa^r,Yeah,,
sd,my husband was complaining the other day,,
sd(^q),because he said every time I turn around you're telling me some new rule about recycling,,
sd(^q),"like yesterday I was tell him, you have to, you're supposed to squeeze the plastic jugs before you take them up there.",,
br,You're supposed to what.,,
sd,Every time he turns around I'm giving him some new rule,,
qw,But what are you supposed to do with them.,,
+,"where you're supposed to squish up the, you know, like collapse the plastic jugs.",,
bk,"Oh, okay.",,
+,Instead of taking them up there solid.,,
sd,And I wish that our recycling center took paper bags.,,
sd,They won't take those.,,
sd,"We like to put our, just put our newspapers in a paper bag, you know, and then carry them up there that way.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,And we have to bring the paper bags back every time.,,
b,Yeah.,,
+,Because they won't take them.,,
qy,"Do you, uh, take your papers somewhere",,
qrr,or does someone pick them up ?,,
sd,"We, we usually collect a, you know, collect a quite a bit",,
sd,"and then we take them, take them in.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"We, um, we don't take our cans up to that center, though",,
sd,"our aluminum cans, we like to take them to one of the places where they pay you for them.",,
b,Yeah,,
sd,"we don't, we don't, um, use aluminum cans",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"so, we generally don't have those to do.",,
b,Yeah,,
sd,"it takes us about a year to save up enough to be worth, you know, worth bothering to go in and do",,
qy,"but. Do you, um, have any ideas on anything that would make",,
sd,"You know, they, they charge you, you know",,
sd,it's like a flat rate I think for picking up your garbage.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"And I know a lot of people it would, would solve the convenience problem if they had curbside pickup",,
sd,and some communities are trying to do that now.,,
sv,And I think that maybe if they only charged for the garbage that you did not sort and have set up for recycling,,
b,Right.,,
sv,"they, they charged you by, by weight of how much trash you were actually sending to a land fill.",,
aa,Yeah,,
ba,that would be a good idea.,,
sv,That that might be a better way to do it.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,"And then people would, would know that it was going to cost them money to not sort their trash.",,
aa,Right.,,
aa,Yeah,,
sv,that would be a real good motivation for people.,,
sv(^q),"You know, because then it would, then it would make monetary sense to them, you know, to say, hey, you know, if I just spend the time to, to sort this out where this stuff can be recycled then I don't have to pay for them hauling it off.",,
aa,Right.,,
aa,Yeah,,
sd,"my father was telling me about some program he read about where you buy your bags, like you buy your garbage bag from the city",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,and you pay more than just what you would pay for an empty garbage bag,,
sd,but then you don't pay any monthly fee or anything,,
sd,"so how ever many bags of garbage you throw away, that's how many you have to pay for.",,
b,"Oh, yeah",,
sv,that's about the same kind of thing.,,
aa,Yeah.,,
aa,Yeah,,
sv,that would be a real good idea.,,
sd,I'm trying to think if there's anything else I could think of.,,
sd,"They are talking about going to curbside pickup in our, in our city MUMBLEx.",,
qw,Where do you live ?,,
sd,"Rowlett, Texas.",,
bk,"Oh, okay.",,
qy,Do you know where that is ?,,
ny,Yes.,,
sd,"And I don't know if they decided to do, or not",,
sd,but I think they said it was going to add like either a dollar or three dollars a month to your bill to have them do that.,,
sv,"Although, I think a lot of those programs can operate at about a break even, break even point",,
aa,It seems like they would be able to.,,
+,without charging people.,,
%,Yeah.,,
h,"I don't know, uh",,
sv,I guess it just depends on how they manage it.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,I don't know how much they get when they sell all that stuff.,,
sd,"The center that they've got now where you take your stuff in I, I think that should be making some money.",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,Since they just have to hire someone to man it a few hours a week.,,
sd,"And they sell, I guess they sell everything to some waste company that comes and gets it.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"But I wish that, uh, more of the cans, you know, like the cans you buy vegetables and fruit and stuff like that in were recyclable.",,
%,I don't,,
sd,a lot of that's that recyclable steel,,
sd,and I don't know anybody that takes that.,,
aa,Yeah,,
aa,that's true MUMBLEx.,,
sd,"Th-, my husband likes Pepsi",,
sd,and those cans are steel instead of aluminum,,
sd,"so we can't, can't ever recycle them.",,
sv,I think it's a good reason to quit buying it.,,
sd,"Um, now I didn't know that",,
sd,"cause we just usually if we're going to, uh, buy sodas they're in the, the two liter bottles.",,
b,Yeah,,
sd,"that's what we buy the most of, unless we're going on a trip or something where we want to",,
b,Yeah.,,

b,Uh.,,

sd,but I still pay them a hundred dollars a semester,,
b,Right,,
b,okay.,,

sd,"So, through my wife's H M O, we've registered for them as our primary care physicians",,

b,"Oh, really.",,

%,yeah.,,
+,a couple hours there kind of a thing.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,"Uh, whereas, uh, here I, uh, things are free enough to, that, uh, the, the actual vacation time per year probably isn't that, isn't that much different",,

aa,Yeah.,,

sd,"the, they've, uh, uh, gone through a couple years ago here where they, uh, will cover you much better if you go to their designated hospitals",,

sd,"so that just routine visits, uh, they will compensate much better for, if you go to their designated doctors.",,

b,Yeah.,,
b^m,Yeah,,
sd,"I think, I was watching something the other day about that actually on, uh, a news special or something like that",,

%,so,,
sv,"Well, and, and I think in the, in the, in the much bigger picture than, uh, to some extent hospitals and doctors have some, uh, fixed amount",,
sv,"and, if, if you don't work for somebody that's got enough clout to, to, uh, uh, give you, you know, give you these rates and make this agreement",,

b,Yeah,,
sv,"and that maybe on the lesser crimes that aren't too severe, that's a little stringent.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,Especially because there's twelve.,,
%,"The thing about it is, I think jury selection, too",,
sv,"a lot of times, uh, the lawyers are able to pick and choose who they want on the jury",,
sv,"and they can sway them that way, too.",,
sd,"That's, that's just it.",,
sd,I don't understand.,,
sv,"You're supposed to, you know, go in if you have, you know, like if you've never heard of the people before or anything",,

aa,I know.,,
sv,"I don't think, well, I guess you really can't",,
qh,"but the other thing is when they have the sensational trials, how they get people who aren't swayed by the news either.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd^t,"So, uh, but then, again, you know, they, the, one of the questions they asked is, should it just be decided by a judge",,
sv,"and that's kind of tricky, too, because a lot of positions the judges are in, they, they can't be fired, you know",,
sv,"they have to, they stay till they retire",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"and sometimes they're pretty partial in their judgements, too.",,
aa,Yeah,,
aa,I agree.,,

fe,"but, hey",,
qh,how many times have you heard of judges being bought over.,,
aa,I know.,,
sv,"You know, so it, it's, I, I think, I think in, in the end, the judge has the presiding, you know, uh, vote.",,
sv,"I think he can be, you know, I, I don't know if it's the way it is in real life",,
sd,but I've seen it on T V where the juries go one way,,
sd,"and the judge to-, totally finds it obnoxious",,

b,Yeah.,,
sd,"Now, I'm not sure if the judge is allowed to do that in everyday life or what.",,
sd,I think in some cases they are.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,But they know they get to decide how severe the sentence is,,
b,Yeah.,,
+,"if it's, you know",,
sv,so that's another thing where they have the power,,

sd,and it was just packed.,,
sd,"I mean, it was a, a fire hazard if we had any kind of assembly there with parents.",,
b,Yeah.,,

sd,"Uh, so we had to do a bond issue and, and, um, vote to take money and either have students bussed to different schools if that's what the prefer to do, or to, uh, work on the, work for another school to be built, which is a good idea",,
sd,"but in the meantime, the school still has lots and lots of kids in it.",,
b,Yeah,,
b^r,yeah.,,

aa,"Well, I think that's, I think that's, uh, true.",,

b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"and, uh, my wife teaches kindergarten here in Richardson.",,
ba,"Oh, great.",,
sd,"Uh, but, in general, I, I think the, the, you know, one of the reasons that we, we, uh, the, chose to live in Richardson when we, when we came here was the, was the schools",,

^2,"We see through the, out the country.",,
aa,"uh, right",,
aa^r,right.,,
sv,"And I think, I think part of that is that, is the, the, uh, a big part of that is just the demographics",,

b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"the, the school systems",,
aa,I think that's right.,,

sd,"but if there was ever any sort of a, uh, if ev-, if I was ever in trouble in school, I was also in trouble at home",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,even more so,,
sv,"and I think that part of it is, is not exactly with the schools, but with the, with the, uh",,
^2,The home,,
%,yeah.,,
+,"the culture that doesn't, doesn't value the education and doesn't value the schools and doesn't support, uh",,
aa,I think that's right.,,

sv,"It is so hard with a family system, um, either divorced or, or just one parent",,
aa,Yeah,,
aa,that's true.,,
+,or just li-,,
sv,"and then, if both of them have to work, even that is a, a hard situation",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"for the children, uh, to, to have a supportive system around them to make school work for them",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"and I think it's real important that the parents work with the school, um",,

aa,that's true.,,

qy,Every day ?,,
ny,Yeah.,,
sd,I mean every second.,,

sd,Right now.,,
^h,Yeah,,
sv,"that's, that's a, that's a tricky one.",,
ad,I'll let you go first.,,
aa,Okay.,,
sv,I think probably the big major change is the role of women.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"I think, one, the women, uh, in the work force.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"And I think the fact that they're becoming, uh, more, uh, how do I want to say, not necessarily politically inclined",,
sv,but they're more apt to be in political offices,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,now.,,
sv,"I think, you know, we've made great strides",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,in that respect.,,
sv,"I think that it, thirty years ago, when, uh, I was newly married, family was very, very important.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,Then I think we veered where the family was not as important a unit.,,
sv,And I think now it's revolving back full circle.,,
sv,I think,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,the family unit is becoming much more important than it was.,,
sv,"Oh, I think it's, that's probably for two reasons.",,
sv,"Uh, you know, the number one is, women wanted to get out of the house.",,
sv,"And the second reason was, is everything costs so much more that if you don't have, you know, equal rights so that your wife gets equal pay, you can't make twice as much.",,
aa,That's true,,
aa^r,that's true.,,
sv,"Well, I know that economically, uh, a wife almost has to work anymore.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And yet, I'm also noticing, uh, in the areas that I'm working and stuff, more and more women are wanting now to stay home with the children where fifteen years ago",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,they didn't.,,
sv,"I mean, you know, they wanted children",,
sv,but they still wanted to be their own person out in the work force.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"But I see, I am seeing women now wanting to stay home",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

b,Uh-huh.,,

b,Yeah.,,

aa,Yeah,,

b,Um.,,

o,Okay,,
sd,"uh, let me see, I've got two children.",,

sd,both preschoolers,,
sd,one is two,,
sd,"and one is, uh, four.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"So, and, uh, this is my first year off",,
sd,"and I've always worked, uh, from the time that they were little",,
sd,and so I decided to hold off on my job for a while and stay home with them and spend some more time with them which I hadn't been doing.,,
sv,"Well, I think that's wonderful.",,
%,So,,
sd,My children are in college.,,
b,Oh.,,
sd,But I teach school,,
sd,"and I teach, uh, middle school age children.",,
b,Oh.,,
sd,"And so I see a lot of, uh, variation in what happens when kids are at home.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"Uh, I have taught school ever since my children were little.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,But the advantage of teaching school is your hours are closer to your children's,,
sd,"and your holidays are, too.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,"So teaching, I think is a, a good career to have and still be able to spend a lot of quality time with kids.",,
sd,"Well, that's what I was doing before",,
sd,I was teaching for Richardson School District.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And, uh, it just seemed like it took a lot of my time with them being so little.",,
b,Right.,,
sv,And it's really hard.,,
sv,"Well, with them being as young.",,
sv,"It was much, much harder when mine were young.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"And, uh, I really didn't have that much of a choice because my husband was trying to finish his, uh, college work",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,and his Master's degree,,
b,Yeah.,,
+,and so forth,,
sd,and so it was a matter of somebody had to have a MUMBLEx job.,,
aa,That's right,,
aa^r,that's right.,,
sd,"And that's what was kind of what, where we were, you know",,
sd,"we, I really didn't have to work",,
sd,but I felt like I really wanted to work.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And I felt, I also felt like, boy, I was sure missing a lot",,
sd,and they were growing so fast,,
sd(^q),"and, you know, it's like, do I really need to work, you know ?",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And I, and it, that choice was there",,
sd,I really didn't have to,,
sd,"and, you know, so I did have that advantage there",,
sv,"but it's different staying home too, you know.",,
aa,Yes,,
aa,it certainly is.,,
%,We,,
sv,"It's an adjustment to make, also.",,
sv,"Well, I think that, uh, we need to spend more family time together with, with children today.",,
sd,"Uh, we made a point to spend a lot of quality time",,
sd,and the activities that we were involved in were the activities the kids were,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"involved in, you know, like, uh, through scouting or",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,"you know, anything like that",,
sd,we participated.,,
sd,"And, uh, we always made a point to have breakfast together and supper together now.",,
ba,"Wow, that's great.",,
%,When,,
%,yeah,,
sd,"when, uh, the kids were in high school, it was harder to always have supper together",,
sd,but we did always have breakfast together.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"So, we, we had supper together as much as possible",,
sd,"but when it wasn't feasible, you know, we kind of kept a master calendar",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"and when it wasn't feasible, well, that was understandable",,
sd,but,,
b,Yeah.,,
+,"uh, we've always tried to spend time to talk and, uh, have some time, together time",,
sd,and we sat around the table,,
sd,we didn't sit in front of a T V or,,
ba,"Wow, that's great.",,
+,that kind of thing.,,
sd,"So I think that's been important, because we do have a close family",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"and even though the kids are basically, uh, grown, uh, they still like to sit down at the table and us all eat together when they're here and",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"uh, have spoken before of, they want that kind of, you know, situation for them when, you know, and their children when they marry and have",,
b,Yeah,,
sv,kind of goes on.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"They do what they see, you know.",,
aa,That's right.,,
aa,They model,,
qy^d,"and, with the dysfunctional families today, I'm sure, with a, as a schoolteacher also, you see",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,what happens to these kids,,
b,Yeah.,,
+,"when these families never communicate or they're dysfunctional as far as the, between, uh, oh, second families, uh, one parent families or",,
b,Uh-huh,,
b,yeah.,,
+,all those kinds of problems that they have,,
qy^d,and then you see them magnified in the children.,,
ny,Yeah.,,
sd,"Plus, you teach middle school",,
%,so I'm sure that,,
ba,"Oh, boy",,
aa,yes.,,
%,"You are really, you really",,
ba,"boy, oh, boy.",,
sd,I taught early childhood,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,so I had the little ones.,,
b,Yes.,,
sd,"And, uh, you know, I saw it there, too",,
sv,"and you, you know, you just oh, it's, it's, kind of an eye-opener.",,
aa,It is.,,
%,So,,
aa^r,It is.,,
sv,"And m, I think most teachers realize the value of quality time with children",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,and I think we make a point to do that.,,
aa,Yeah,,
aa,I think you're right.,,
sv,"Because we see, we see all the time, the outcome of not doing that",,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,"and I think if we weren't so interested i-, in children, in child care, then we wouldn't be teaching anyway.",,
b,Right.,,
%,So,,
b,Right.,,
sd,"Uh, I wish we could reach more of the rest of the world.",,
aa,Yeah,,
aa^r,yeah.,,
sv,"I think, uh, the major problems in education are not what's happening in the schools",,
sv,it's what's happening in the families.,,
aa,I agree,,
aa,yeah.,,
sv,"And, uh, they expect us to, you know, have, create miracles at school and fix all the problems and take over the roles of the parents as well as that of the teachers",,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,and you get to a point where it's completely impossible.,,
aa,Yeah,,
aa,I agree.,,

o,Okay,,
qo,"uh, what do you consider an invasion of privacy ?",,
sd^t,"Uh, I was just now told that's what the topic was",,

b,Uh-huh.,,
+,for example.,,
sd,"And, uh, I guess recently one of the T V stations here, uh, ran a series of, uh, news casts on unauthorized credit card usage and how easy it was to get a person's credit card numbers.",,

qo,What do you think of that ?,,
^h,Uh,,

b,Oh.,,

bk,Okay,,

b,Uh-huh.,,

b,Right.,,

b,Right.,,
sv,And you didn't want that to happen.,,
sd,"And to me, it had always been that way.",,
sd,"I mean what happens is, you have a government, right",,
sd,"and this government controls everything, right",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,and then you have the people inhabiting the country,,
sd,and these people have nothing to do with the government itself.,,
b,Right.,,
sd,And these people are the same as you are.,,
b,Right.,,

aa,Uh-huh,,
aa^r,uh-huh.,,
b,Right.,,

aa,Uh-huh,,
aa^r,uh-huh.,,

aa,Uh-huh,,
aa^r,uh-huh.,,
%,"You know, but I think, I think the thing is, is that there, the thing",,
sd,"like they were saying they go, you know",,
sv,like Libya could start a nuclear war because of whoever is behind the button. But not the U S S R,,
b,Right.,,
sv,The U S S R,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,wouldn't do it.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,Because they got too much at stake.,,
sv,"But I guess there was concern, uh, that I-, Iraq would use, you know, nonconventional warheads with, with the chemical weapons and things",,
sd,but yet it didn't happen.,,
b,Yeah.,,
qh,I mean,,
sv,Well,,
+,why not.,,
+,"My, my point of view to that is, is that it would have had so much, I mean the attack would have been so complete on Iraq if they had.",,
sv,"I mean the first, you can imagine the first, uh, chemical weapon used",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"that would have meant a total attack of the Iraq country within, you know, three hours of when the weapon was shot.",,
bf,"Oh, so you think it was fear that kept Iraq from",,
aa,Right.,,
+,using it.,,
%,"But, yet the",,
%,"And what happens is, what happens is",,
qh,"suppose they get Saddam Hussein, which they eventually will",,
sv,he's got one less thing to go against him.,,
aa,Uh-huh,,
aa^r,uh-huh.,,
sv,"I mean, if he were to use that, he might as well commit suicide",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"because he's going to be captured and, you know.",,
sv(^q),"But the U. S. also makes a lot of, uh, you know, treaties with other people like saying, okay",,

b,Right.,,
^q,We'll overthrow you,,

aa,"Uh, no.",,
aa^r,No.,,

sv,"But yet you know, as, as the parallel Russia is that Saddam Hussein is using the chemical warfare",,
b,Yeah.,,

aa,"And I guess that makes sense what you said that, uh, within their own borders they feel freer to do",,
b,Right.,,

b,Right.,,
b,Yeah.,,
%,"And, uh, you know, there's, there's just, you know",,

sd,That's my thing.,,
sv,I don't believe that anybody should die,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,you know,,
%,"and so then, you know, you have",,
sv,because what happens is,,
sv,"suppose I'm, I go to war",,
sv,and I'm holding a gun,,
sv,and I'm just looking at myself holding a gun,,
sv,"and whoever shoots first survives, you know.",,
sv,But that same person also has a family,,

b,Right.,,

sv,and to me that's ridiculous.,,
sd,"You know, I mean, I just don't believe it.",,
sv,I think there are other ways to fix it even though sometimes there aren't,,
sv,"but it's pretty hard to think that, you know, people are just going to shoot each other down",,
sv,and it's legal in a situation like that.,,
sv,Well,,
b,You know.,,
+,"or that, that it resolves anything in the end. That",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,that negotiations couldn't resolve.,,
aa,Yeah,,
sv,"I mean, I mean Saddam Hussein lost so much money during the war that it was ridiculous",,
sv,"and he, all he was trying to do was make money at the beginning",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

qy^d,"Well, it sounds like neither one of us thinks that the Soviet Union is a real threat to the U S.",,
nn,No,,
sv^e,"I, I don't think so.",,

b,Right.,,

b,Right.,,

b,Um.,,

b,Yeah.,,
+,or at least what area you want to be in.,,
sd,"Uh, I had the unpleasant experience of going through several schools that were very specialized.",,
sd,I went through a number of them,,
b,Um.,,
+,"uh, undergraduate schools, before I found a, a good school that was more general, uh, to give me time to make up my mind.",,
ba,"Oh, that's interesting.",,
sd,"I went to a, a liberal arts school, actually, at first",,
sd,"and you weren't really even, um",,
+,they didn't expect you to choose any sort of major or anything at all until you were in your second year,,
sd,"and then you, you know, you had, I think you had to pick it, by, by, by the end of the second you had to pick some sort of major",,
sd,but until then they didn't sort of force you.,,
sd,"They, they sort of forced you to run around taking classes in everything until then. Certain requirements",,
sd,"so that, so that you had to sort of get a general feel for everything",,
sd,so it wasn't that specialized.,,
%,So that,,
ba,That's wonderful.,,
sd,"I'm a great co-, proponent of liberal arts education",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,for anybody.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"Uh, being an engineer now, I believe in it even more strongly than I did before.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"I was just on a committee recently, actually sponsored by, uh, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, trying to sort of, you know, where, where they were just trying to figure out how to fit science and liberal arts together, you know, because there are people who are getting just wonderful science educations and not getting enough liberal arts",,
sd,and then the other way around as well,,
sv,people are getting pure technical science educations and not getting very good liberal arts sorts of issues.,,
%,So,,
sd,"Well, thus far it's working to my advantage.",,
sd,"Uh, the great gap historically has, with engineers, has been while they may have all this technical information, they have no way of imparting it to, except to another engineer.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,And I have the ability to listen to them and then translate that into something that nonengineers can understand.,,
qy^d,"Well, that must be helpful.",,
nd,"Well, it's",,
qy^d,That could be very helpful.,,
+,"a lot of fun, at the moment.",,
b,Yeah,,
sd,"well, I figure that, that, that's probably the thing I would most tell any parent, you know, to tell their kids, I think, probably",,
sv,make sure the kid goes to a school where they get sort of a general education,,
sv,"and save specialization, I guess, for graduate school, unless they're sure they want, early on they want to do something like engineering or something.",,
%,Or they can,,
sd,"Even at that, I have a son, that, who's only nine at the moment.",,
sd,But I see him very rapidly becoming the engineering personality,,
sd,"and, uh, if he decides to pursue that, I'm going to insist that he spend two years at a liberal arts college, before I'll even let him go to an engineering college.",,
b,Um.,,
aa,"And, yes",,
sd,that'll add one year to his education experience.,,
b,Yeah,,
ba,"but, but that's a good idea.",,
%,"Well, where I am right now",,
sd,actually I'm at the University of Rochester,,
sv,"and that's a pretty good engineering school, I think.",,
sv,I think we do some,,
aa,Yes,,
aa,it is.,,
+,they have pretty good engineering here.,,
sd,"They also have pre-, a fairly large liberal arts college as well. A sort of, a separate, you know, arts and sciences college.",,
sd,"Um, and I believe the engineers are sort of required to take classes in, in everything",,
sd,"and I know people, I do, uh, I do work in language processing",,
sd,"and, and, and at least one person who's in my field started off as an engineer, started off as an elec, elec, an electrical engineer student, and then switched over at some point into language processing, because he found that he enjoyed it more.",,
sd,So they do force them,,
sv,"people are forced to sort of take all different kinds of classes here, which I think is wonderful.",,
aa,"Oh, I agree.",,
sd,"Uh, I have the experience, uh",,
sd,the last school that I went to was Mississippi State University,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,which is historically an engineering and agricultural school.,,
b,Right.,,
sd,"Uh, the typical land grant university",,
sd,every state's got one.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"Anyway, while it has both engineering and liberal arts, the engineering students tend to cluster together.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"You know, they're in classes together, even when they're outside of the engineering department.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,And they don't learn the communications,,
sd,"they don't learn the thought processes of other fields of, of endeavor.",,
b,Um.,,
sd,"It's, you know, it, that's kind of like if I were king for a day, and got to, and got to make one rule.",,

%,Or so-,,
%,yeah,,
sv,"or, or, or, or some other thought provoking area, you know.",,
aa,Very true.,,
sd,"We had, uh, when I went to undergraduate, we had uh",,
sd,went to Brandeis,,
qy^d,"don't know if you know of it or not, uh",,
sd,"we had, uh, uh, a requirement freshman year of just Humanities.",,
sd,"Then you were given a choice of, um, you know",,
sd,"there were ten or twelve, or whatever, fift-, or fifteen different courses that you could take",,
sd,"but they all centered, they all came out of Philosophy, English, and Literature departments",,
sd,"and they were, they were, they were a set of assigned readings everybody had to read, you know for",,
sd,"so the first year Humanities courses everyone had to read the Iliad an, and so forth",,
b,Right.,,
sd,"and what they did do, was they all approached it from, from very different",,
sd,"so that you could have one class in the philosophy of something, that the philosophy of Greek mythology or something that actually approached this, or, um, one literature, you know, or a, a literature course or, just all sorts of different perspectives on it",,
sd,"and people got to choo, pick and choose",,
sd,"but, but by the end, everyone had a good sample of, of, of, sort of how to think about these things nonscientifically, you know",,
sd,"and, uh, and that sort of forced them.",,
sv,"But I believe that, that, that you, one of the, one of the best things to do, at least for me in school was, was, I was sort of forced to take lots of different kinds of courses.",,
sd,"Um, I was forced to take, I think you know, some sort of art history course",,
sd,and we all grumbled about it at first,,
sd,"but then, afterward, we all wound up taking extra art history classes, because it just seemed like something, something we didn't totally know nothing about, but just enjoyed very much doing",,
sd,"Yes, I re",,
+,"and something I would never would have done if, if I wasn't forced to take it.",,
+,I remember that experience,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"that and, uh, extra music classes.",,
b,Yes.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And that, and that really is something that, that I notice",,
sd,like I talk to a lot of my friends at school that are more specialized,,
sd,and they don't have that.,,
sd,"They just, you know, they went in and took their courses that they were expected to take",,
sd,and that was all.,,
sd,"They never had some of the more fun classes, I guess MUMBLEx.",,

sd,My wife is not an academic at all.,,
sd,My wife is sort of in the real world,,
sd,and so I sort of hinge halfway out in the real world,,

sd,"Especially she works in, uh, uh, she works in the, she works for a temporary agency, ac-",,
%,and I never would have had,,
sd,she's the office supervisor,,
sd,"I never would have had any, I've, I've learned much just sort of by watching her and her, and her business as well.",,
%,So yeah,,
%,"so I, I can, I can see where that might be a",,
sv,"Well, vicarious learning is a wonderful thing.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,It certainly means that we don't have to experience everything,,
sv,but experience is a wonderful,,
%,That's my,,
aa,oh yeah.,,
+,teacher also.,,
aa,Yeah,,
aa,agreed,,
aa^r,agreed.,,
sd,"Well, I'll, I'll take that, I'll take that MUMBLEx and think that through a little bit. Uh.",,
sd,"My wife, a-, as I may have mentioned, just finished a doctorate a couple of years ago.",,
b,Yes.,,
sd,"an-, and she pursued her education along the lines that I did",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,with lots of break in between.,,
sd,And she feels reasonably comfortable teaching now.,,
sd,She has an awful lot of experience to draw on.,,
%,No longer,,
o,Okay.,,
qy^d,"Well, I take it since you selected this topic that you have children.",,
nn,No,,
sd^e,I don't,,
bh,You don't ?,,
sd,but I have nine younger brothers and sisters.,,
ba,My goodness.,,
sd,"So. Well, I have two daughters",,
sd,"and, um, they're past this, they've been latchkey children for a while",,
sd,"and they're almost where I can start saying they're, you know, young adults",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,so I don't have to worry about child care too much anymore.,,
ad^t,"Um, we're supposed to discuss what criteria we would ask",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,or expect.,,
%,"I would assume it's, you know, if you were looking for a day-care center or something like that.",,
%,"Well, if I were look",,
sv,Or probably even baby-sitters would be the same thing.,,
aa,Exactly.,,
aa^r,Exactly.,,
sd,"Um, I think my, my top priority would be that it would be someone who would be responsible and someone that would actually like children.",,
aa,Yes,,
sd,I would think someone older,,
sd,and I would want to know if they've had any past experience with children.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
b^m,Uh-huh.,,
sv,And I think that varies.,,
sv,I think a lot of your criteria vary with the age of your child.,,
aa,Yes,,
aa,that's true also.,,
sv,"Um, you know, it's, it's, once they get to a certain age it's almost more important that it's someone that can entertain your child as opposed to someone who's, you know, really, really qualified",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,per se.,,
sv,"Um, with a, with a baby, definitely have to be someone who knows how to handle a baby and would know how to respond to an emergency.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
%,So,,
sd,"Well, um, I did a lot of baby-sitting when I was younger.",,
sd,I'm twenty-two now,,
sd,and I did most of my baby-sitting when I was between the ages of thirteen and sixteen.,,
sd,"But, um, the only thing people ever asked me",,
sd,"well, of course, they knew I came from a family with younger kids",,
sd,but they really didn't ask me if I was used to children or not.,,
sd,The only other thing they asked me is what I would expect in pay.,,
b,"Oh, uh-huh",,
b^r,uh-huh.,,
sd,"You know, and, um, I was pretty surprised because if I had a child and someone, you know, I would want to know, I personally would ask for people that that person has baby-sit for before.",,
sd,"Well, I, my experience, I baby-sat a lot also at, when I grew up",,
sv,"and, um, coming from, you know, that background and the background as a parent now, I think the reason that people don't ask a whole lot of questions is a, a lot of times baby-sitters",,
sd,I know I did this with my children,,
sv,"it's, you get somebody where you kind of know the family already.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,And that gives you so much basic knowledge that you don't ask a whole lot of questions.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"Becaus-, because I had three younger brothers and sisters myself",,
sd(^q),"so they, they thought, okay",,
^q,"she knows how to, how to treat children.",,
b,Yes.,,
sd,"Well, see when, um, I first got my mai-, my first baby-sitting job was pretty strange.",,
sd,"Um, this lady saw us at church",,
sd,"and she was a you, you know, she was a younger lady.",,
sd,She didn't really know my mom.,,
sd,She knew my mom by name,,
sd,and that was it.,,
sd,"And, um, she knew that I was one of the oldest girls in my family",,
sd,so she just asked my mom if I could baby-sit.,,
b,Uh-huh,,
b^r,uh-huh.,,
sd,"You know, she really didn't know my name or anything, you know",,
sd,I thought that was pretty strange.,,
sd,"You know, and she had two children.",,
sd,One was still in diapers when I started baby-sitting.,,
ba,Wow.,,
sd,"So, um, she pretty much, you know, just assumed that I would know, you know, how to handle them.",,
sd,"So, I wa-, you know, I enjoy kids",,
sd,and I get along with them very well,,
sd,so there's no problem.,,
sd,"But, uh, with today's world and the kids today, uh, there's no way, I can't say that I would just ask someone, you know, that I didn't know like that to baby-sit.",,
aa,"Oh, I agree with you",,
sv,"but there again she, you know, she knew, knew of your family",,
aa,Uh-huh,,
aa,that's true.,,
sv,"and she, and she met in a safe setting, such as church.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,So she was going on those two instincts.,,
sd,Just the same I know myself,,
%,I never,,
sd,and I was very very protective on who baby-sat my children.,,
sd,"Oh, I would be too.",,
sd,"And, and in i-, it really shocked me",,
sd,"because just about six months ago someone came to my front door, rang the doorbell.",,
sd,She had just moved in the neighborhood.,,
sd,She had her daughter with her,,
sd,"and the daughter was, oh, about a second grader.",,
sd,And she was actively looking for people who would baby-sit her child.,,
ba,"Oh, my.",,
sd(^q),"And I thought, well she doesn't know me or my children from anything.",,
b,Huh-uh.,,
sd,"And it was, I was almost more reluctant of letting my older children go baby-sit for her because I didn't know her",,
b,Uh-huh,,
b,yes.,,
+,then she was reluctant of letting strangers into her house.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"So, I mean people are so different.",,
aa,"Oh, I know.",,
qy^d,"Um, well, I real-, I, obviously you've never had to look for a day care or anything.",,
nd,"Well, I did, I did have, um, my, my child, uh, in a day care for just a short time a-, when my oldest was about two and a half",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,and I worked just a part-time job,,
sd,"and, uh, in, in those situations, um, what I did is I'd, I went in",,
sd,"and, you know, I made a few phone calls",,
sd,I went in and visited.,,
sd,I asked questions such as how they would discipline a child.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"Um, that was a concern with me.",,
sv,"Um, you know, c-, you, you learn a lot by going in there",,
sv,"and they e, they explain to you, you know, what their day consists of and what their general rules are",,
sd,"and, um, that's, you know, that's as much as I know.",,
sv,You probably could get really good feedback from a lot of other working mothers,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"you know, that have done this over and over again.",,
%,Well,,
%,But I,,
ad,go ahead.,,
qw,How did you stumble upon the day-care center ?,,
qy,Did you just look it up in a phone book,,
qw,or what was it ?,,
sv,"Um, I think lots of people, I, I think I went by location for one thing.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,I think most people do that.,,
sv(^q),"I think you start out with the criteria of, you know, do I know of anything",,
^q,or do I know anyone who has their child in a day care,,
%,and,,
b,Yeah,,
sv,"there is, I would say most people would probably go by word of mouth.",,
aa,Right.,,
aa^r,Right.,,
sv,"And then, you know, I mean, even at that you have to consider the logistics of it.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"You know, I mean, you're not going to take your child south of town if you work north.",,
aa,Yes,,
aa,exactly.,,
+,"Yo-, even if that's the best one in the whole wide world.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"So there, there are just so many considerations.",,
aa,Uh-huh.,,
qy,"Then again, did, um, money come into play with it at all ?",,
na,"Oh, money is always a factor in my life",,
+,definitely.,,
sd,"I've never, you know, I've never had the luxury of not having that be a factor. Um, even in something as important as day care.",,
sd,"I know if I didn't have that stipulation, I would have done things differently",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,you know.,,
sd,"Um, Montessori school would be something that I would have pursued",,
sd,but that's always a little bit more expensive than what I could look at.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"Um, and I was very very fortunate in that I didn't have to do that on a full-time basis.",,
b,Yes.,,

b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,my husband's from Nebraska,,

sv,and then you get a couple of weeks of that Indian Summer,,
sv,and then it's cold,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,and I wish it were several months of that.,,

sd,some of my favorite's like a Friday night when it rains,,
sd,and you really didn't have anywhere to go,,

b,Yeah.,,
sd,But I did a walk last night,,
sd,and it seemed like it was a little bit hot still.,,

sd,that part I don't care about.,,
aa,"Well, I agree, absolutely",,
sv,"and you know, it's all relative",,
sd,because I was from West Texas,,

sv,and I still think so,,
sd,but then this summer we went to Orlando for a week,,
sd,"and it was so humid there that your, um, all your windows were fr-, were wet every morning.",,

sd,We have a little garden that we have,,
sd,and,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,and so it really helps our garden,,
sd,"and, you know, even, I don't know if that's because plants are just that way",,
sd,and they like rain,,
sd,"or, it seems they thrive when it rains",,
%,"they just, really",,
aa,Yeah,,
aa,I think so too.,,
sd,I know our grass needs mowing twice as often,,
b,Uh-huh.,,

b,Yeah.,,
%,but it seems like here,,
sd,"I would like it to rain and then be over, and then not rain for a while.",,

%,Um,,
b,Yeah,,
sd,there's one very close to where my parents are,,

sd,but my dad's the type he wouldn't want to spend the money on anything.,,

^2,Visit.,,

b,Uh-huh.,,

b,Yeah.,,

b,Right.,,

sd,"I, uh, recently just moved to Texas from, uh, South Dakota and Nebraska",,
sd,"and I guess in terms of gun control I've always, uh, been raised with the, uh, idea in the Constitution that, uh, citizens had a right to bear arms",,

aa,Yeah,,
sv,"it, uh, moving to this area, of course it happens everywhere",,

sv,"It's, you know, it's just getting all of a sudden so much worse.",,

sd,I don't know what the answer is.,,
sv,I know that it's scary,,
sd,and yet I hate the government constantly telling me what I can do and what I can't do,,
sv,and that's basically what the gun control would end up being.,,
aa,"I, I think so",,
sd,"and, and there's always the, uh, the, uh, the old, uh, saying that keeps coming up that if a person wants a gun bad enough they'll, they'll get one",,

aa,"Well, it's very true.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,"It's not the law abiding citizen that, you know, is, is dangerous with the gun.",,
sv,It's the ones that are going out and stealing it.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,And I said I think the only way I would be in big favor of gun control is if they could absolutely guarantee that nobody would have them.,,

sv,"I mean, they'd have to be almost world-wide, which we know would never ever happen.",,
aa,Yeah,,
aa^r,yeah,,

b,Yes.,,
sd,"And, uh, you know, that didn't bother me, uh, too much",,

bh,"Oh, yeah ?",,
qo,"So, how do you feel about guns ?",,
^h,Let's see,,
sv,I think that gun control has come up because there has been some crazies that killed people with guns,,
sv,and I think that's the problem that we need to address is why these people want to kill other people rather than the instrument they particularly used in the assault,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
%,"whether, you know",,

na,Sure.,,

sv,"a, a short waiting period would be appropriate to, uh, take care of the heat of the moment type things",,
sv,but,,
b,Uh-huh.,,

%,"but, uh",,

sd,"See, well, you, I don't do it either.",,

b,Yeah.,,
+,always afraid that someone's going to steal my purse.,,

sd,"I mean, it's a rare day when I even have seventy-five cents in my purse.",,
b,Yeah,,
sd,"you know, enough for a phone call",,
sd,and that's about all.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"But, uh, other than that, that's the, that's the way I use them.",,
sd,"I know some people that uses them so bad that every one of them that they've got, they c, they can't charge any more",,
+,you know,,
sv,and I think that's terrible.,,
aa,Yeah,,

b,"Oh, yeah.",,
+,bigger purchase or something.,,
aa,Yeah,,
sv,"because if anything ever happens that you do need to, you know, you have excellent credit",,
sv,"why, it really does help.",,
aa,Yeah,,
sv,"and I think it's more convenient, too, in a lot of cases",,
sd,"like whenever we go on trips, we always, you know, use our, our Visa or our Mastercard or whatever.",,

sd,"And then, um, you know, we really don't have to pay for it out of our own pockets until about a month later",,
b,Uh-huh,,
b^r,uh-huh.,,

b,Uh-huh,,
b^r,"uh-huh,",,
+,for it later.,,
b,uh-huh.,,
b,Yeah,,
sv,"well, I think it's better to use credit cards, too, like I say, because yo-, there's so many people around any more that's watching what you're doing",,
b,"Oh, yeah.",,
sv,"and if you pull a wad of money out of your pocket, they're going to hit you over the head.",,
aa,Yeah,,

sd,I'd just soon use my credit cards and,,
b,Yeah.,,

sd,"And also, if you, if someone did happen to steal your credit card, my husband was saying that if, you know, you notice it within, I think it's twenty-four hours, you can report it in",,
sd,"and I, he said the most you'd ever have to pay is fifty dollars for them to cancel, you know, whatever payments you had",,

b,Right.,,

ny,Yeah,,

sd,I worked for a large corporation in the past,,

sd,"and, uh, there is a lot of profit that's coming in",,

b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,they even hate to give out unemployment,,

b,Uh-huh.,,

sv,"That's pretty good for, you know, being a, a school district type program.",,
aa,Right.,,
sd,"And we have the eye glasses, the health care",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

ba,Wow.,,

ba,That's extremely good.,,
o@,MUMBLEx,,
b,Yeah.,,
x,MUMBLEx.,,

b,Oh !,,

sd,"So I've been looking at big corporations and saying, the big corporation that I've worked for in the past had the pension plans, had the big health, health care, uh",,
sv,you had your insurance,,

sv,"Uh, they don't have as good as insurance packages as big corporations.",,
%,And,,
aa,Right.,,
sd,The only trouble we've had here in Massachusetts is the town and state employees,,
b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,My father's retired from the town of Framingham,,
b,Sure.,,

aa,Sure,,
aa^r,sure.,,

aa,Yeah,,
aa^r,yeah.,,
sd,"But, uh, you know, I think the schools are at, where the schools isn't just the school system",,

sd,They took in the whole town plus all you know,,
qy,Is it a union ?,,
na,"Uh, we have the teachers union",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,but the town of Framingham pays the benefits,,
sd,and,,
ba,"Oh, that's pretty good.",,
+,"that's all the town workers, water and sewer",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,and where it's a very large town,,
sd,"it's actually, should be a city",,
sd,but they kept it a town.,,
b,Sure.,,
sd,"Uh, where it's extremely large, they were able to offer a little bit more which was",,
b,Yeah.,,

b,Uh-huh,,
b,yeah.,,
b^r,Yeah,,
ba,I know what you mean,,
aa,and that's true.,,
sv,"I mean, yo-, i-, it does end up being quite a bit when you have to hire somebody for that position, sure.",,
%,Yeah.,,
aa,Right,,
sd,"because of most of our, you know, the town employees, as far as, uh, electoral positions, are part-time.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,So it works out good because we,,
b,Sure.,,
+,reap the benefits of it,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"and, uh, but as far as shopping for a job, I'd rather shop for the benefits than the salary.",,
ba,"Well, that's it, you know",,
sd,"and, and I've kind of looked around, uh, at that, uh, too.",,
sv,"Because, uh, salary wise I don't think I'm making as much with a big corporation because I think when you look at big corps or large",,
sv,"I'm talking like hugh companies like Three M, uh, I'm, uh, Honeywell, uh, Texas Instruments",,
b,Right.,,
sd,"I know people that are, that have vacation times, and bene-, benefits that I wouldn't even dream of in a small corporation.",,
sv,You bring it up to the owner,,
sv,"and it's like come on, you know.",,
sv,Partly it's because the owner wants to keep getting richer and richer.,,
b,Right.,,
sv,"And, and, of course, when it's a small corporation, it also wants to expand",,
sv,so that money is spent,,
qy^d,I don't know if you feel the same,,
sv,"but, uh, when it comes to telling kids that they have to do, uh, two or three years of service into some kind of community, I don't know if that's appropriate for a government to suggest that and say, you know, you have to do two years of community service before you can be a citizen",,
sv,"or, you know, in the aspect that we're telling kids that this is what is suggested for you to do.",,
b,Right.,,
sv,"And, uh, I, as far as a high school course, I could see it as, uh, maybe a social, uh, sociology course",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,to where a student would get credits if they were to be involved with some kind of community type of program,,
sv,and,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"to me, that's fine to have a student do that for like four or even a year",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"but to tell them that they had to do two years thereafter, post high school, of community service, I, I'm not quite sure if that's appropriate",,
sv,"Um. Well, that's a good idea to have it as a study program for school where it be more on a voluntary basis",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

aa,Exactly.,,
b,Yeah.,,
%,A,,

b,Right.,,

b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"uh, people be more eager to do it.",,
aa,Exactly.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,And doing it for a purpose that they want.,,
sv,The other thing is this,,
sv,"I have thought about this on many times when you get these, uh, young troubled teenagers that, uh, don't have like the perspective of, uh, uh, of the community, a sense of community or perhaps the sense that they may have problems",,
sv,but there are other people out in the community that may have problems.,,
sv,Then I can see it as like maybe a probationary type of thing.,,
sv,You have to do so much as far as in,,
b,Right.,,
+,community service now.,,
sv,"If they were, you know, th-, abusive type of situation perhaps then they would have to work with the victims of abuse.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"Or if, uh, they destroyed some property around the, uh, area, then they would have to do, uh, to restore it and perhaps, uh, work, uh, for the community to beautify it or whatever",,
sv,but,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"I could see that working in, you know, cases where it might be young teenagers getting in trouble with law and teaching him that there is a whole",,
sd,"And that's, I think they have done that",,
sd(^q),"and judges have said well, you know, this is what you're going to get for a, you know, a misd-, misdemeanor or something",,
^q,you may end up having to do some kind of community service,,
sv,so I could see that as something that might occur in the court system for those that are troubled,,
%,so,,
aa,Uh-huh.,,
ba,"Uh, that's a good idea.",,
sv,"Uh, I think they should have more programs like that.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"And I think, uh, us being taxpayers, we pay for, uh, people that's in jail or",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,in trouble anyway.,,
aa,Sure.,,
aa,We sure do.,,
sv,So they should be programs set up by the government that could utilize those forms in different areas.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
aa,And,,
b,Yeah.,,

b,Yeah.,,
b^m,Yeah.,,
sv,"But, uh, the thing is is that's not enough of that kind of stuff going on, uh",,
b,Yeah.,,
aa,"because like you say, is a lot of crimes and stuff or misdemeanors",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
qh,"so why have someone in year-, jail for a year or two for a misdemeanor.",,
sv,"And sometimes, you know, putting them in jail doesn't really help",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"because there's nothing in there that would reb, rehabilitate re,",,
aa,Exactly.,,
+,rehabilitate,,
b,Yeah.,,
+,rehabilitate them,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"and then when they get out, they",,
sv,because they have this stigmatism of being in jail.,,
sv,"And there's a lot of anger, sure. You know, especially if they haven't went through treatment",,
sv,"and they dealt with other people in the, uh, system of prisons which, uh, you, you always deal with somebody that's a little bit worse than yourself next to you or whatever.",,
sv,"I would say the crimes would probably be, you know",,
sv,"if you went in for a certain crime, there might somebody that has done a crime even worse than what you have",,
sv,"so you're dealing with people, uh, that may, uh, be an influence later on",,
sv(^q),"and, uh, an issue of anger would be is that I went to prison for a year or two",,
^q,but I didn't get any rehabilitation,,
b,Uh-huh.,,

+,that's part of it too.,,
sv(^q),"But, uh, like my husband was saying, maybe some of the problems we brought on to ourselves is that these women back in the nineteen fifties, uh, were staying at home with their kids and then made the decision, well, jeez, you know, I'll go out and get a part-time job.",,
sv,Got a part-time job,,
sv(^q),"and then financially, they got themselves into well, I'll have the boat",,
^q,I'll have the car,,
sv,and,,
b,Right.,,
+,it's nice,,
sv,"and really women, past generation women have done it to women of this day and age too, uh",,
sv,"because it is now, our financial situations are as, it almost takes two people to bring in an income to support a family now",,
%,and,,
sv,It's hard.,,
sv,It really is hard.,,
sd,I know that my husband and I have to do a lot of sacrificing,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,to keep me home.,,
aa,Sure,,
sd,I did it,,
%,"And, uh",,
+,for three years,,
sd,"and, uh, it cost us a lot of financial problems doing it",,
sv(^q),"and pretty soon, you know, you're at the limit where you've got to say okay, you've sacrificed for, you know, so many years at home",,
sv,"and you're not getting any further, you know, along",,
b,Right.,,
sv,and you have to make that decision to go back to work part-time or go back to work full-time,,
sv,and you have to make that decision,,
sv,and it's a tough one.,,
aa,Right.,,
sv,I think,,
%,And I,,
+,"one of the things that people look at too though, is, uh, spen-, how they spend their time with their children",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"I think with working moms, if you can get them ma-, the bosses to give you almost like a rotation like they're going to do with year-round school",,
b,Sure.,,
o,Okay.,,
b^m,Okay.,,
qo,"So, what do you think about it ?",,
%,Should,,
sv,"Um, I like the idea of nursing homes as a, as a growing choi-, the choices you have in nursing homes now, whereas used to, you used to have only, you put, you know",,
sv,"when, when people got to the point where they were debilitated and couldn't take care of themselves",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,and there was no other choice.,,
sv,You couldn't take them in your own home,,
sv,then they went into a nursing home.,,
sv,"You know, maybe you lived too far away to care for them",,
b,Right.,,
sv,or your daily job or whatever prevented it.,,
sd,"But, um, I like the choices you have now, where they can go into an apartment type setting and have some, basically have a independent life-style, but assisted care.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,"And then if things deteriorate, they can go to a second level which is, you know, like, where they prepare their meals for them",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"and, and they still live somewhat independently",,
sv,but they have people checking on them and making sure they have hot meals.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"And then where the same community a lot of times will also have the third level, which is full care, you know, where some people can't, where they're in a wheelchair or where they're in a bed",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,and they can't get around,,
sv,but then they have full care.,,
sd,"But I really like those, those options now",,
sd,"and, and I think about it more often because my husband's parents are, they're very active right now",,
sd,"but they're seventy-five and, and seventy-two.",,
sd,"So, that comes up somewhat more often in my thoughts as I see these things",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,because of their age.,,
b,Yes.,,
sv,"Um, it's, it's funny",,
sd,"because, um, I know people at, that are in all three, and people that work, you know",,
sd,"I know someone that w, works in all three different stages like you said.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And I have known, you know, people close to me that have been in all three",,
sd,and I have seen them like go from where they're in an apartment building,,
%,"they, we call it, um",,
sd,"well, we have high rises",,
sd,"and it's just for elderly people, you know",,
sd,"or most of, most of, one of their spouses has already passed away.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And it's really nice for them because then they're with people their own age, and people that have gone through things exactly what they have gone through.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And, it's, it's really nice to go and see them, you know, where they can still get around and everything",,
sd,"and they still, you know, do their own thing",,
sd,"but it's, it's really nice to see them because",,
%,I mean sometimes,,
sd,like I had a great aunt,,
sd,"she lived with us for, um, three months, and, because she's starting to get Alzheimer's disease.",,
sd,And I know I have a bunch of younger brothers and sisters,,
sd,"and I know it was hard for me as well as it was for them to, to actually sit down, because she doesn't like doing things that the younger kids like doing.",,
b,Right.,,
sd,And to actually sit,,
sv,so it's really nice to see that.,,
aa,Yeah,,
sv,"that's some of the things I would find important before I, I would look into that for a person, is, is, is like you're saying, a good mix of people who have the same interests.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And, uh, and the programs",,
sd,"here they have different, uh, besides just different levels within the same program, they have different types of programs.",,
sd,They have several areas.,,
sd,They have one area in town where the people,,
sd,I guess a lot of it comes with money.,,
sd,"I, this, this one area is a bit more expensive",,
sd,and the people who probably are living there have had more money in their life.,,
sd,"But, but things that people where they have similar interests.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,Like you're saying,,
sd,"and the programs that they have, where, where some of them will have dances once a week",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,and some of them sponsor different crafts,,
sd,and they go to the arboretum to see things,,
sd,"and they make sure that if they want to go to church, there's a bus there.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And, it'll, or, you know, or someone will transport them to a specific church, even though it's, you know, maybe it's thirty minutes away",,
sd,"because it's a big, you know, Dallas area is a big metropolitan area.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"But a lot of these places have, have churches or have, have individual transportation.",,
sd,"That's, that's something I'd look for, something that would make me happy personally if I had to live there.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"Because I don't think a lot of people really, even in the nice ones, and even in the ones where they can live fairly independently, they really don't necessarily like it",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,because they're not in their own home.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"So I think those kinds of things, to make it more homelike and to make it more, um, enjoyable for them. That'd, that'd be one thing I'd look for, along with the, uh, health care aspects",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"to make sure they had, you know, that it was clean and that they had good doctors and nurses.",,
aa,Yeah.,,
sd,"Um, I'm in college",,
sd,"and I'm, I'm only twenty-one",,
sd,"but we had a spee-, I had a speech class last semester",,
sd,and there was a girl in my class who did a speech on home care of the elderly.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,And I was so surprised to hear how many people,,
sv,"like whenever they're in, you know, the older people, they're like, um, fastened to their beds so they can't get out just because they, you know, they wander the halls.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"And they get the wrong medicine, just because, you know, the, the aides or whoever just give them the wrong medicine.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,"And so many of them, you know, are",,
^2,"Are overmedicated, too.",,
aa,Yes.,,
sd,"And it was, it was awful to hear what, you know, what some of these people really went through.",,
sd,"And I forget the percentage of people that, you know, that she had said",,
sd,"and this was, I mean, she did research on it and everything.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
b,Yeah,,
sv,"that's one of the things that, that we don't think about as we get older, and the, the money that it now requires to, uh, be in one of these places.",,
sv,Because some of these people that are just on social security,,
sv,and if they don't have any living relatives,,
sv,perhaps they never had children,,
sv,"or if their children, you know, passed away before they did",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"they can be in some places that are, you know, that, that are not good.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,"Or they, they have very minimum, minimal care",,
sv,"and the, the care that they are getting, the people who are giving it are pro-, are paid at a minimum wage",,
sv,"and they just do, they don't care as much.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,"And, and like you said, they're trying to make it, the caretakers in some cases are trying to make easy on themselves to the point where they're putting people in bed or overmedicating them so they'll stay in one spot and not do anything.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"That certainly would be something to, to watch for.",,
sv,"Because you've got, with some of them being, some of these places can even be two and three thousand dollars a month to stay in, MUMBLEx.",,
aa,I know,,
sv,"and some-, and sometimes they share a room",,
sv,and it's just a little cubbyhole,,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,and they share it with another person,,
sv,and they're still paying that much.,,
aa,"Oh, yeah",,
%,so you've,,
sv,"It, it, it just sometimes, it just seems ridiculous.",,
aa,Yeah,,
sv,"you've got to really strike a balance in what kind of care, what kind of level of care you need, and then what you can, unfortunately what you can afford at the same time.",,
aa,Uh-huh,,
aa^r,uh-huh,,
aa,yeah.,,
sd,"Um, I've been lucky",,
sd,"well, my mom's, um, parents, they're both in their, in their, uh, eighties",,
sd,and I was just home for spring break,,
sd(^q),"and my grandma said something to me about, she goes, well maybe we'll just sell the house.",,
sd(^q),"She said, it's getting too big for us to take care of.",,
sd(^q),"And I was like, no",,
^q,no,,
^q,no,,
^q,stay in the house as long as you can.,,
sv,"Well, like there are other communities, too, that aren't necessarily a nursing home.",,
sd,"I had an aunt who lived in a small town in Texas that, um, was in a",,
sd,"it was a, it was a housing division.",,
sd,Each person had their own little bitty house,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,that they had built,,
sd,"and it was, um, supplemented",,
sd,"their, they were, most of them were on social security",,
sd,and they got some kind of supplemental aid besides from the state government.,,
sd,But it was this little bitty one bedroom house,,
sd,but it was a separate house,,
sd,"and they had a living room, and a bedroom and a kitchen",,
b,Oh.,,
+,and a bathroom.,,
sd,"So they still had, they had, and they had people who came in who, um, supervised, th-, all these houses",,
sd,were like fifteen or twenty of them all right together kind of like on one block.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And they had a, a supervisory, um",,
sd,"wasn't a house, really",,
sd,"it was, it was more like, um, a headquarters",,
sv,"It sounds like, uh, an apartment or som-",,
+,"or something, anyway, where they, they staffed it three shifts a day so that someone, if they needed someone, they could ring",,
sd,"and, and someone",,
b,Oh.,,
+,could come to their house.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"And that, and they always cooked",,
sd,"then they had, they had the choice, you know",,
sd,they lived in their own little house.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"They had their own possessions still in there, to some ex-, you know, some of them.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And they could make their own breakfast if they wanted to, and their own dinner",,
sd,and they always had somebody come in for lunch.,,
sd,"But they had people who did, you know, they didn't have to mess with the yard.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,They had people who did the yard,,
sd,"and they had a maid that, uh, uh, service that came in and cleaned everybody's house.",,
sd,So they didn't have to worry about that.,,
b,"Oh, yeah.",,
sd,"And it was really a nice, it was really a nice compromise, especially, because she felt like she was still living in her own house.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And she still had her own couch, and her own bed",,
sd,"and it, it really helped a lot",,
sd,and she was a lot more comfortable,,
sd,"and she didn't resent MUMBLEx like having to be in a situation, because she still had a lot of her own possessions.",,
bh,"Oh, really ?",,
ny,Yeah.,,
sd,"See, now we've run into a lot of problems where our relatives were",,
sd,"well, I've lived here for thirty years",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"and we've built this, and this is our home",,
sd,and we have nothing else to show for our lives,,
sd,and we don't want to leave.,,
b,"Oh, yeah.",,
sd,"Uh, we've run into a lot of that.",,
b,Yeah,,
sv,it would be hard to.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
%,"That's, that's why this",,
sd,"she was, she felt that way, too",,
sd,"but when, it helped that she got to still be in a house and still have some of her own stuff.",,
b,Yeah.,,
%,"And I guess that, that",,
sd,"it was a pilot program I think, where she lived",,
sv,so it's probably not widely available.,,
aa,Uh-huh,,
aa,yeah.,,
%,That's what like,,
%,"well, um, now I know we have an ol",,
sd,we call it an old folks home,,
sd,but it's basically a nursing home too,,
sd,but everyone has basically their own room.,,
b,Yeah.,,
%,"And they're allow, you know, th-",,
sd,none of them have cars because they can't drive.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"But if someone would come to get them, you know, they're allowed to leave with them",,
sd,and there's a staff there that makes supper for them,,
sd,and each person has a chore,,
sd,like maybe Wednesday night it's George's turn to set all the tables.,,
b,Uh.,,
sd,"And it's really nice because that keeps them going, too, rather than just sitting around.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"And I know, um, our youth group goes over",,
sd,"and we play bingo with them and, you know, like,",,
ba,That's good.,,
+,stuff like that.,,
sv,Everybody needs some sense of responsibility.,,
b,Uh-huh,,
sv,"An even, even if it's just a little bit.",,
aa,Yeah,,
sv,just to keep them going.,,
b,Yeah.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
bf,"So, it's, it's more like living with a big, in a big house where it's your turn to, to set the table, like you're saying, or whatever",,
aa,Yeah.,,
+,instead of being waited on hand and foot all the time.,,
aa,Uh-huh.,,
b,Yeah,,
ba,that would be nice.,,
%,But I think before i-,,
%,like you,,
sv,"I don't think y-, I don't think it's right to just put someone in it.",,
sv,I think they would have to agree to go in it.,,
aa,Yes,,
sv,unless they're at a point where they're mentally,,
b,"Well, yeah.",,
+,incapacitated.,,
sv,"Like you're saying with Alzheimer's and stuff, they're going to be some people who have to be there",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,whether they want to or not,,
sv,"and that's when it's important to really check out the medical aspects of it, when you're, when you're in something like that",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"that they'll get the kind of medical care they want without, or they need, without overdoing it.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"Without doing something to make this, you know, to keep, like you're saying, to keep them still to make the staff happy.",,
b,Yeah.,,
%,So.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
o,Okay.,,
b^m,Okay.,,
sd^t,I forgot all about that that it had to be pressed.,,
%,"Um, but anyway, so, so as far as",,
sd,"w-, we really, we don't want to get in the habit of watching a lot of T V",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"because we both were raised, you know, that way, you know, where our parents sort of stuck us in front of a T V to be the baby-sitter.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,And we just don't want that.,,
sd,"We want more communication and interaction, you know, amongst us as a family.",,
sd,And we both like sports,,
sd,"so we figured, well what, what better way to get out and, you know, be together as a family",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"and also, you know, have it be good for you.",,
sd,"And plus, we like, we both like to cook",,
sd,"so, you know, that's something we spend time together too, is, you know, cooking and, uh, preparing meals and stuff.",,
sd,"So, uh, but as far as that, that's about all we've discussed as far as for family.",,
b,Really,,
b,okay,,
sd,"well see, I'm the third oldest of twelve children.",,
x,MUMBLEx.,,
ba,Oh my gosh.,,
%,"So like I said, I",,
sd,and I'm only twenty-one.,,
sd,I'll be twenty-two next month.,,
sd,So there's nine that are younger than me.,,
sd,My youngest sister is five.,,
b,Oh yeah.,,
sd,"And like I sa, I don't have any children.",,
sd,I'm just engaged,,
sd,and I'm getting married in October,,
sd,and we haven't discussed this at all. Um.,,
b,Yeah,,
qy^d,"long way down the road, right.",,
ny,Yeah,,
sd^e,exactly.,,
sd,"But, um, now I've noticed that like, while I'm at college, and when I go home, my bro-, you know, my",,
sd,I'm really close to the younger ones,,
sd,"and, um, like, when, when, like when I do go home they enjoy just laying around me, you know",,
sd,"like if we do watch T V at night, they just like enjoy just, like laying on top of me or something.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,They like that.,,
sd,"But, um, as far as that goes, like we play games",,
sd,I play like Old Maid and Fish with them,,
sd,"and w-, we play board games",,
%,and when it's ni,,
sd,like I'm from Pennsylvania,,
sd,"so when it's nice out, we go outside",,
sd,and we like to play like kick ball and softball and stuff.,,
%@,So.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+@,We do a lot of that.,,
sd,"And in the summer everyone is like, I think there's like seven of us still at home",,
sd,and all seven are in a sport,,
sd,like also MUMBLEx the girls are in softball,,
sd,and the boys are in baseball.,,
sd,So all summer we live on hamburgers and hot dogs and sports,,
sd,"that's it, you know.",,
%,"Well do you, do you",,
qy,"so you go, if you're, if you're not doing any kind of sport thing you go to one of your sisters' or brothers'",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

ny,Yes.,,

na,Right,,
ny,yeah,,
sd^e,we go and watch.,,
b,Yeah.,,

sv,"I mean, you're, you're participating",,
sv,"but you're not, you know.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,I mean at least you're encouraging them on and stuff,,
%,and that's,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"because, um, even if our kids, you know, get into sports that we're really not interested in, I don't, I want them, you know, to know that we're still there",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"so to speak, as a family.",,
sd,"Well, it's funny because, um, well, my mom and dad both were kind of athletic.",,
sd,They both grew up on a farm,,
sd,"but although, you know, it wasn't them playing I notice like whenever I was playing softball and such, my mom and dad got into it more than I did.",,
sd,"I mean, they'd be in the audience screaming and yelling, you know",,
%,so.,,
b,Yeah.,,
bf,Cheering you on and stuff.,,
sv,"A lot of times the parents get into it just as much as, as the kids",,
sd,"and I found, like a lot of times like when we went on to tournaments and stuff, it was really funny because the crowds would like get into argu-, you know, get into fights, who can scream louder, and you know, everything.",,
sd,So it's really pretty funny to see my parents get into it,,
sd,and they're not really even participating.,,
b,Yeah,,
sv,"well, that, that would be fun.",,

%,what if,,
qy,do people go off in their own little groups with that many ?,,
qy,"I mean, did like some people go to their rooms and MUMBLEx",,
ny,Yeah,,

sd^e,"the, the one down thing about having that many people in our family is you real-, we really don't have any privacy when we're at home, because you couldn't possibly have a house with twelve bedrooms.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"But, um, like I say, you know, I'm twenty, I'll be twenty-two next month",,
sd,and I'm closer to the younger kids than I am the ones my own age.,,

sd,and my fianc3e and I are paying for most of the wedding.,,
sd,"And then, then my brother right behind me, he moved out",,
sd,and he has an apartment,,
sd,and he works,,
sd,and then the next one down is in the Marines,,
sd,and he's out of the house.,,
sd,"So, it's kind of like they don't, you know.",,
sv,"Well sometimes I think maybe the larger families create more independence in the children though, you know.",,
sv,I mean,,
aa,"I, I think they do.",,
+,you don't expect anything because there is not enough to go around for everybody,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"so you, you kind of have your own independence on going out and getting it yourself",,
aa,Exactly.,,
+,if you really want it.,,
sd,"Like, uh, well, I find it a lot when I'm up here at college because I've always had a bank account",,
sd,I've always had my own checking account since I was in like tenth grade.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"You know, I would work in the summer",,
sd,"and there's a lot of kids up here that would have no idea how to even do a checkbook or, you know",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,"to, to manage money.",,
sd,"Like my roommate's laughing at, you know, at me, you know, because their schooling's paid for.",,
%,Or manage money or know,,
%,yeah,,
qh,"know, you know, how to get, how to even go about getting money.",,
aa,Yeah,,
aa,uh-huh.,,
qh,"You know, how to get a job or you know, just what, you know, what, when you get a job, what your responsibility is.",,
b,Yeah.,,
qh,Are you going to blow all that money,,
sv,how easy it is to blow money you earn.,,
aa,Yeah.,,
sd,"And see, and then, my mom and dad, like whenever, like we would go out and we would get a summer job",,
sd,and then we would start blowing money,,
sd(^q),"and my mom said, well that's stupid for you to be blowing money.",,
sd(^q),"She goes, okay if your going to blow your money on other things, she goes, you can just pay for your life insurance.",,
sd,"So then we, when we all graduated from hi, college, from high school",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,we all got,,
sd,"we're still, like I'm still covered under my mom and dad's life insurance because I'm still in school",,
sd,"but I have my own policy, too.",,
%,So I had a poli-,,
sd,"you know, my mom and dad got it set up, you know, you know, helped me to get it and everything",,
sd,and I have my own policy,,
sd,and then I pay for my own life insurance too.,,
sv,Wow,,
sd,And then,,
+,you've really got responsibilities.,,
+,"And then, like, my mom and dad, because there's so many of us, and because of the way the laws are, you know, now, if we want to",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"Because my mom said, that's silly to let one of the older one's drive it",,
sv,"if we were in a wreck, you know, you can be sued for anything now.",,
sd,And she said that's really not fair to the younger kids.,,
sv,If we were careless and was in a wreck and they got sued,,
sv,and then they can take everything away from my mom and dad,,
sv,and the little kids would have nothing.,,
aa,"And I, I agree with her.",,
h,"You know, I just, I don't know.",,
b,Yeah.,,
%,Wh-,,
sd,"So if, you know, if we want to drive, we pay our own insurance",,
%,and.,,
sv,"So really, I think, sometimes there's an advantage",,
sv,"I mean, sometimes it's good to have a bigger family because it does make you more independent.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,It makes you know that you can't take anything for granted,,
b,Yeah.,,

b,Uh-huh.,,

bh,Really ?,,

sd,and everything looks real,,
sd,and you can touch everything and stuff.,,
bh,Are you serious ?,,
ba,"Oh, man.",,

sd,"and, uh, I mean sometimes it, sometimes it's funny",,
sd,sometimes it's not,,
sd,"but, uh, you know",,
ba,That's cool.,,

b,Okay,,
aa,That's true.,,

qw,"I, uh, was thinking about salaries and benefits and",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,"Well, um, I, we just recently graduated from Rice University",,
sd,"and, uh, we were going through a lot of job interviews and things",,
sd,"and some of the things that were important to me, uh, when my husband was looking for his job, was, um, hours, you know",,
%,we,,
sd,he'd been in graduate school so I was used to his not being home at all.,,
b,Yeah,,
x,.,,
sd,"So I was, you know, didn't want him to have a job that would make him kind of be on call all the time, and have to go in at any time, and",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"you know, even on the weekends and, um, and things.",,
sd,"So that was important to me, and also insurance for the fa-, our family",,
b,Sure.,,
+,because we'd like to be able to take care of our medical needs and not be thinking so much about whether or not you can afford it.,,
b,Yeah,,
sd,I don't ever want to have to worry about that.,,
sd,That's real important to me.,,
sd,"Um, you know we have that, that Aetna",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"that's what we, the insurance that we have right now.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"Us, too.",,
sd,"When we were in Colorado, they had, um, a different type of H M O there that I really liked a lot.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"It was, um, not that kind of H M O -s where you have to go to their, their sort of like clinics, you know",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,but this was just an H M O where you could go to private practice doctors and to the regular hospitals and all that,,
sd,"but it was with a certain list of, of doctors that, you know, participated",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,in the H M O,,
sd,"and, um",,
ba,"Well, that's nice.",,
+,"you know, then you only had to pay the",,
sd,"for us it was a five dollar co-payment every time you went to the doctor, and, uh, three dollars for the prescriptions.",,
b,Uh-huh,,
ba,that's good.,,
sd,"And, uh, I especially liked the prescription, especially since my children tend to have ear infections all the time.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"That, those prescriptions can be very expensive.",,
ba,"Oh, I know.",,
sd,We just went through that ourselves.,,
sd,"We just, you know, are like fifty dollars for this series of antibiotics and things.",,
ba,"Oh, I know",,

b,Uh-huh.,,
+,that just about breaks the bank right there.,,
aa,Yes.,,
aa^r,Yes,,
sv,it's pretty bad.,,
%,"Well, yeah",,
sd,"and we, um, we were interested in having dental insurance, too",,
sd,"because, um, having been in school, we kind of put things off",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,and only went in when we knew there was a problem somewhere and stuff,,
%,and,,
qy,Do,,
+,we wanted to be able to go in and have our teeth cleaned and just checked all over,,
%,and,,
+,"Do you have the basic plan or do you have the, the other one ?",,
sd,"We have, um, you know",,
sd,"we're at Aetna with an, uh, ex-",,
sd,"we have like the medi, the dental insurance is separate.",,
qy,Is that what you mean ?,,
na,Right.,,
sd,I don't think it's the basic,,
sd,I think it's the other one.,,
sv,The one that's like you get additional,,
sd,they'll pay a little bit more,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,I think for the different procedures.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,We just have the basic right now,,
sd,and for most things it tends to cover it.,,
sd,"We don't too many major, um, expenses at this point",,
sd,"but we have been able to find do-, dentists that will accept pretty much whatever the basic plan pays.",,
sd,"A couple of times we've had to pay, oh I don't know, three to five dollars but",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,that's not that bad.,,
aa,No,,
ba,that's great.,,
b,Yeah,,
sd,we need to go shopping for dentists and things like that too.,,
b,Yes,,
^h,"and, let's see",,
sd,"besides insurance, other things that we looked at, um",,
sd,"well, my husband does not like to commute",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,very far,,
sd,"and, and we don't like him to be, you know, having to drive an hour to work or something.",,
aa,No,,
sd,we don't like that either.,,
sd,"So we kind of looked for where, where the, uh, his office would be located",,
sd,and,,
qy,Is his office in Plano ?,,
+,"well, he's at, you know, he's at the one that's at, um, seventy-five at, uh, six thirty-five",,
b,Uh-huh,,
b^r,uh-huh.,,
+,"and so we, by living in Plano we're just about fifteen minutes away.",,
b,"Oh, that's not bad.",,
sv,"Um, especially when they finish all the construction out here",,
b,Right.,,
sd,"and we didn't want him to let, you know, to",,
sd,like we had some job offers in the New York area,,
sd,"and we thought, well, you know, he would be really commuting",,
ba,"Oh, yes",,
ba,you're not kidding.,,
sv,"and not only is it, you know, trouble to have to drive, but it takes time away from your home and your family when you're out driving.",,
ba,That's right.,,
sd,"And, um, so, that was something that was important to us",,
sd,"and, because, like I say, we kind of felt deprived that he had been in school and been away from us for so long",,
sd,"that we were anxious to do everything we could to have, you know, made us be more together",,
%,"and, and what other",,
qy,can you think of another thing that you guys looked at,,
%,and,,
sd,"Well, those are some of the things that are very important to us too.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"Um, we, we'd like, you know, other benefits that are provided, um",,
sd,"the athletic facilities that you some-, sometimes take advantage of",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"I think that's, that's pretty nice",,
sd,but I have to say that since we've come here we haven't done it too much though,,
sd,"we haven't enrolled in too many of the classes or, or any of that.",,
sv,"But that's, that's a nice benefit to have.",,
aa,Uh-huh,,
ba,that's true.,,
sv,That's really important.,,
sd,"Um, also, what, um, opportunities there would be for advancement, I think, we looked at besides just, you know, what salary you would be having now.",,
sd,"But when, when could, uh, your salary increase",,
b,Right.,,
sd,"um, is there, was there somewhere to go.",,
b,Yeah,,
sd,"that's, that's one of, I think, the hard things right now",,
sd,I mean they're going through some tough times,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,to say the least.,,
sd,I know many of us are thankful that he still has a,,
sd@,job.,,
aa,Yes,,
^2,that we can make our mortgage payments,,
aa,"and, yeah",,
ba,that's really true.,,
+@,"Uh, one of the drawbacks, I think, of working for a big company, is often times, you do have to follow pretty rigid, um, guidelines",,
sv,"um, if, if an employee is especially exemplary, I think it's often",,
sv,"in a smaller company it's a little bit easier for them to say, Hey, you know, this person did a wonderful job, give him a big bonus kind of thing.",,
sv,A lot of times,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"smaller companies have bonus plans, where I think in a large company it's hard to do that because there're just so many people to deal with",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"and you have to have guidelines, you know, for salary increases, and things like that",,
sv,"that's one of the things that, that happens when someone, when you're dealing with a large company.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
%,But.,,
sd,"But, we also were interested in, um, you know, being sure that he felt like he liked the people that he would be working with",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

o@,Right.,,

b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"It's only been, not even a year yet",,

b,"Yes, well.",,

sd,Or we may be having to drive to Plano,,
sv,you never know.,,
b^m,You never know,,
sd,we're hoping that that won't be the case.,,
sd,"We, I think one of the most deciding factors of why we chose, um, this area is that, um, my husband was raised in Irving",,

%,And being,,

sd,that's the same,,

sd,I wonder what it would be like,,
sd,"I mean, I wanted to be close to family, but I also thought it would be harder to be close to family.",,
aa,Yeah,,
sd,sometimes it can be.,,
sd,But it's turned out really good,,

ba,That's good.,,

o,But anyway.,,

sv,"We have gone more into the business aspect of, like I say, of, I don't know, working more",,
sv,"and we, I think we've even gone into more the labor aspect of it also.",,
aa,Yeah,,
aa,definitely.,,
+,"With the pay and everything, you know.",,
sv,"I feel that, uh, we've missed as far as the top jobs go.",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,"You know, the higher echelon.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"Because if you look at most corporations, there isn't a woman, you know, that's on the board of directors, or that type of thing",,
sv,they are mostly all men.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"There may be a few, but very incidental.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"And I really think that it will be a long time, probably, before we see that.",,
sd,"In one sense, I'm an older person, in my fifties, so I feel that we've lost some things in the sense that women have to work today.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"You know, that they are not in the home by choice anymore.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"It's mostly, you know",,
sv,"even if you want to say home, you really can't.",,
ba,And a lot of times you can't,,
aa,yeah.,,
sv,"You know, it's gotten to be a two income family to just survive today between taxes and the cost of living",,
sv,"and I don't think raises have kept up with, you know, a lot of the stuff, you know, as far as your medical insurance and just groceries and gasoline and all, you know.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"So I think that we did come a long way in the sense that we are allowed to vote in, you know, like you say, we're out in the labor force, but I think we've lost something too.",,
b,Yeah,,
sd,"my mom, she's a housewife",,
sd,"and, well, there is twelve kids in my family",,
sd,"so my mom never could really work, you know, because she was kind of pregnant from day one.",,
sd,She never really had a chance to work.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,She worked before she got married,,
sd,"but, uh, she, uh, she doesn't believe in",,
sd,she's very old fashioned.,,
sd,She doesn't believe in the woman working unless she has to.,,
sd,That's what I mean,,
sv,and,,
b,Yeah.,,
+,"you know, there's a lot of truth to that.",,
sv,"If you are not going to have a family, then that's fine",,
sv,"then, you know, a career is a smart choice.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And I think it's great, but if you, you have a family, I think you owe the family a responsibility.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"And to have children and just get a day care or someone to take care of it, and not really have the bonding process that takes place with babies and stuff, you know",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"I, I think that the mother and the child lose",,
sv,and I think that's why there is so many problems,,
b,Yeah.,,
+,"you know, with kids today",,
sv,because they don't have the family roots anymore.,,
sd,"You know, I'm not saying that, that it's totally gone, but it's nothing like what it used to be.",,
b,Yeah,,
b,uh-huh.,,
+,"You know, in that sense.",,
b,Yeah,,
sd,"and also like my mom, my mom thinks",,
sd,I mean she's kind of right with it,,
sd,"when both partners of the marriage work, she feels that that's taking more away",,
sd,that's increasing more unemployment for people that need to work.,,
aa,"Oh, definitely.",,
+,"You know, like for, for the men that don't have jobs",,
sd,"if, you know, she feels if there is women out there just because they want to do it, she said, you know, they could stay at home",,
aa,That's right,,
sv,they don't want to take care of the kids.,,
b,Yeah.,,
+,And the house and that kind of thing.,,
sv,"That's very true, but then they shouldn't have a family.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"That's what I'm saying, you know",,
sd,I think it's great that women have a choice today.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"That there are ways to prevent families, you know",,
sd,like basically there's contraceptives and,,
b,Yeah.,,
+,all kinds of ways to prevent pregnancies.,,
sv,There is no need to have children if you don't want them.,,
qo,What do you think about that,,
qy,"do you think that, uh",,
qo,what do you think about the women that are not having families because they want to continue their business ?,,
sv,That's fine,,
sv,"that's, that's the freedom of choice.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,And I agree with that,,
sv,because anyone who has children that doesn't really want them isn't going to be a good parent.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
h,"Well, I shouldn't say they are not going to be a good parent.",,
sv,They won't be a caring parent.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,Like they won't have that,,
sv,Or they won't be as good as they could be.,,
aa,Right,,
aa,that's what I mean,,
sv,they'll feel like it's a job.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,It's not like something that they really wanted.,,
sd,Like I had three children,,
sd,"and I mean I, I wanted every one of them.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,I'm not sorry I had any of them,,
sd,and I worked third shift for a good part of my life just so I would be home with them.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"You know, I had to work, but I tried to make it as painless as possible.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"In fact, at one time I worked as a second shift",,
sd,and one Saturday morning we were all sitting at the breakfast table,,
sd,"and the kids were talking, daddy this, daddy that, daddy this, daddy that",,
sd,and I was sitting there.,,
sd,It was like I didn't belong anymore.,,
sd,And it was because I had worked for about nine months,,
sd,and when they were coming home I was going to work.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,And I wasn't there at supper time or bed time,,
sd,or they couldn't tell me what went on at school because they would be coming in the door,,
sd,I would be going out.,,
aa,Exactly.,,
sd,So we were,,
sd,I felt I was losing my family.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,And that's why I said that's it,,
sd,"I either have to quit or, you know, try something else",,
sd,so I went on third shift.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,And I worked that shift for eleven years.,,
ba,"Oh, my.",,
b,Yeah.,,
o,Bless you.,,
sd,Just so that my kids would have me at home.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"You know, and I feel that's very important",,
sv,it really is,,
sv,and it's too bad because mothers miss out on so much too.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,So I mean in the sense that we've come a long way,,
b,yes,,
sv,but we've sacrificed a lot to get there.,,
aa,Yeah,,
aa,"I, I agree.",,
sv,"And, uh, I really think that if, uh, like after the second World War when women went to work in factories and all that, that was like out of necessity, because the men weren't here anymore.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,But then it got to be a point where they got some independence.,,
sv,"And they just enjoyed the income, the extra.",,
aa,Exactly.,,
sv,"A man can afford the necessities, a woman affords the luxuries.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And I notice today kids, you know",,
sd,like we had apartments before we had homes.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,And we had to walk before we had a car.,,
aa,Exactly.,,
sv,"And now kids at sixteen years old, they have their birthday",,
qh,what do they get,,
sv,they get a car.,,
ba,"Oh, I know.",,
sd,"And to me, it's like we've lost our values in this country.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,We really have,,
sd,"and I, I'm not trying to be, uh, you know, a prude or old fashioned or anything, but I, I don't think if you, unless you earn something and you've worked for it, and you have a sense of pride about it",,
sd,"because while I did this in, you know, no one gave it to me.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,You will take better care of that,,
sv,and you will prize that possession.,,
aa,Exactly.,,
+,More than someone handing something to you.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,And it's just like college too,,
sv,"I think that if a kid goes to college, and you can help them, fine, but I don't think you should pay the whole way.",,
b,"See, yeah",,
sd,"see, now, my parents, there is no way they could afford to send twelve kids to college.",,
aa,Of course.,,
sd,And so far there is only two of us that have gone,,
sd,and my older brother has paid his entire way,,
sd,and I'm on my,,
sd,I have six weeks left,,
sd,"and I'll, you know, I'll graduate",,
sd,and I paid my entire way,,
sd,and that's the way it'll go down the line,,
sd,and like I don't have a car because I'm paying for college,,
sd,and if I want a car,,
sd,"my parents always said if we wanted a car, we paid for the car, and we paid for our own insurance",,
sd,and I think that's right,,
%,because,,
b,Sure,,
sv,"but I'll bet your values are a lot higher, you know, and your self esteem and the, the way you, uh, you know, think about things is probably",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,a lot more common sense,,
b,Yeah.,,
+,than these kids that don't have that responsibility.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"Like I've had my, you know",,
sd,like I know kids up here that have their own cars,,
sd,and money is just given to them,,
sd,like they still get their allowance,,
sd,they are twenty years old and they still get an allowance.,,
sd,"Well, I have held a summer job, you know, since I, you know, I was in the eleventh grade",,
sd,and I have had to take care of my own money,,
sd,I have my own checking account,,
sd,I pay for my own life insurance,,
sd,and I know a lot of kids that don't even know,,
sd,"I mean I tell them I pay for my own life insurance and their mouths just drop to the floor, you know.",,
b,Sure,,
sv,they probably don't even have any.,,
sv,"Well, if they do, they don't know it, you know.",,
aa,Yeah,,
aa,exactly,,
sd,"and that's what I say, you'll, you'll be so much better off for it as you get older",,
sv,"because, you know, a lot of kids resent things that parents tell them and stuff",,
sv,but it's because you've been there.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,And no one can tell anyone anything,,
ba,"Oh, I know.",,
sv,"you know, you are going to find out for yourself",,
sv,"but I mean I don't think you should just not listen to advice, even if you don't take it, just listen.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"You know, there is no harm in that, whereas sometimes you can't even get that from a kid, you know.",,
+,"Just attention, you know.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"But really, uh",,
qo,"what do you feel the changes in the future, like with the abortions and that type of thing, women in politics and",,
%,Uh.,,
+,"president someday, maybe.",,
sv,Actually I think abortion is going to take a turn where there is not going to be as many,,
sv,because I think contraceptives are going to be more popular.,,
sv,I mean I realize that they are popular now,,
sv,"but I think, I really think people are going to start using more contraceptives",,
sv,"and with the abortion, I don't think there is going to be as many abortions, but I don't know what women will do when they get into politics, you know, about abortion.",,
b,Yeah,,
b^r,yeah.,,
sv,I think it will be freedom of choice.,,
sv,"Well, I still think people have a choice.",,
sv,"You know, if you can live with it, and it's, you know, your conscience is clear",,

sv,and that I'm afraid that we would have to stay.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,"The thing, uh, the other thing too, when this all started if you, you know, if you did much reading on the thing, you know, Kuwait, the country of Kuwait was just, you know, somebody's uh",,
sv,"you go back to World War I when the, uh, Ottoman empire broke up",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

b,Uh-huh.,,

b,Right.,,

sv,"for whatever reason it's, it's actually there.",,
sv,"Well, Iraq has had, uh, designs on that place since nineteen twenty-two",,
sv,"so, you know, it wasn't like something that just suddenly popped up.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,"And it's just that this was an excuse, you know, to make some noise.",,
sv,"Now, something that I read in the paper the other day that I thought was kind of interesting was that the Arab, uh, uh, their version or vision or whatever the United States, now, is somewhat changed in that we won, you know.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,"Now, now we are a, uh, a legitimate player",,

%,"the, the",,

b,Right.,,

b,Right.,,
%,So,,
b,Right.,,
sv,that kind of ups our stock in there just a little bit.,,
sv,It makes us more legitimate.,,

sv,"and, you know, we've got the power.",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,Which is why for centuries or hundreds of years the British and the French had so much influence in there,,
sv,because they'd go in and they'd win something.,,
b,Right.,,

b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,but I decided that I don't like grass,,

sd,I had never thought about that.,,
sd,"I could probably plant one and bring it in, and just like I bring my plants in every year.",,
sd,That'd be neat.,,
sd,"Well, I got a patio",,

b,Uh-huh.,,

sd(^q),"And so, um, but he said, No",,

qy,you know what day lilies are ?,,

sd^r,Day lilies.,,

sd,That what the look like,,
sd,but they only bloom for one day.,,
b,Oh.,,
sd,"They'll, um",,
sd,you'll have a bud the evening before,,

sd,It only blooms for one day.,,
qy^d,"And then it's done, completely done.",,
ny,Uh-huh.,,
bk,Oh.,,
%,Yeah.,,
sd,"But, um, they look like orchids, is what they look like",,

sd,and,,
b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,"and then they have like, you know, the real velvety looking stuff inside",,

ba,"Oh, MUMBLEx really pretty.",,
sv,"They are, they're beautiful.",,
sd,"Uh, I have a friend when I lived out in the country",,
sd,"and she had belonged to this kind of society that like every year, you know, or every so many months they would send you different bulbs that they came out with.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,And I mean they were real expensive.,,
sd,"They were like, well",,
sd,the most expensive one that she gave me a bulb for was like thirty-two fifty for one bulb.,,
ba,"Oh, my gosh.",,
sd,"So what she would do is she would plant them, and they multiplied.",,
sd,"So the next year when she, you know, weeded them out",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,"And, I mean, I have some of the most beautiful day lilies that you've ever seen.",,
sd,"So, when we decided to move, it was really funny because, like I said, I had a whole bunch of different kinds of things",,
sd(^q),"and I kept saying, Well, I want to take a few of these, and I want to take these, and I want to take these.",,
sd(^q),"My husband finally said, Look, are we going to take the grass ?.",,
^q,Can we leave the grass ?,,
sd(^q),"I said, Yes, we may leave that.",,
bf,"MUMBLEx take the whole grass, the whole yard.",,
sd(^q),"And we had a tree that was like seventeen foot tall, or something like that, that he said, No, no, I am not taking the tree.",,
sd,"You know, I mean, every time we went outside, he'd look at something that was humongous, you know",,
^q,No,,
^q,we're not taking that.,,
sd(^q),"But the last day, he said, Can't we leave the grass",,
sd(^q),"and I said, Yeah",,
^q,I think we will leave that.,,
ba,That'd be funny.,,
sd,"But, I brought",,
sd,"my kids, when they were little they had given me some azaleas",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

b,Yeah.,,
sd,"And you know, I brought, I brought as much as I could bring",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"without, you know, really tearing up their place.",,
sd,"But, just like, um, you know",,
sd,"the people that bought ours, bought the place, but, um, I knew that they would, you know",,
sd,"if I left like one bulb of each one of them, by this year they'd have ten bulbs of each one of them.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"So, it wasn't like it was going to be this big raw place or something, you know",,
sd,it would cover it right up.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"But, I just couldn't see it, you know, going off and leaving everything like that.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"Because this house, I really liked it and everything, but the yard was a lot to be desired.",,
sd,Oh,,
b,Oh.,,
+,there was nothing.,,
sd,These people,,
sd,we have one ugly pine tree.,,
sd,"I mean, and it is ugly.",,
sd,"I even tried making it look nicer, you know",,
sd,I tied the yellow ribbon around it,,
sd,and it was so ugly.,,
sd,"Oh, it did not help, let me tell you.",,
sd,I took it off and put it on my door.,,
sd,I did not want to call attention.,,
sd,"I mean, it was terrible.",,
sd,So really the plants that I brought over and put out here are just about all.,,
sd,"I don't do any of the mowing or, you know, edging and all that",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,My husband does all that stuff.,,
sd,But that's because I'm allergic to the grass.,,
ba,"Oh, that'd be awful.",,
sd,I love going out in the Summer in the grass.,,
b,Really.,,
ny,Uh-huh.,,
sd,Now I like to go to the beach where the sand is,,
sd,because then it doesn't make me ill.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"And, um, well even up here at school, you know, it gets hot, and we have the windows open",,
sd,well they mow the grass up here sometimes six o'clock in the morning.,,
sd,"And just to smell the grass, it's just",,
sd,I just love the smell of freshly cut grass.,,
b,Yeah,,
sd,"I used to until it, I got so allergic to it.",,
sd,"I don't know if it's all, well",,
sd,I went and had some tests run and just about all the kinds I was allergic to.,,
sd,But it's not as bad here,,
sd,"like Saint Augustine, I think, is what we have.",,
sd,And it's not as bad as it was when we were out in the country.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"But out in the country, I mean",,
sd,"if I went outside while he was mowing the grass, I was going to have a gigantic attack.",,
ba,Oh my gosh.,,
sd,"So, um, I get shots for it now, too.",,
sd,That helps a whole bunch.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"But, one good thing about it, see I don't have to mow the grass",,
%,or MUMBLEx,,
sd,"I mean, that's really nice.",,
b,Yeah,,
sd,you said that you had a garden.,,
qw,What all things do you plant in it,,
qr,or do you like to plant in it ?,,
sd,"Well, the first thing we always plant is tomatoes",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,every year.,,
sd,I don't care if we don't have anything else,,
sd,we're going to have tomatoes.,,
sd,And then we plant cucumbers,,
%,and,,
b,Uh-huh,,
qy,do your cucumbers come good ?,,
ny,Oh yeah.,,
b,Really.,,
sd,"Sometimes when my dad has, like",,
sd,that's the one thing no one is allowed to touch except my dad.,,
sd,He takes care of all the cucumbers,,
sd,because he said the vines are just so,,
sd,"at our house, as soon as you touch a vine, it's like it completely dies.",,
b,Really,,
ny,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"It must be the, uh",,
sd,Sometimes we have really good luck with them,,
sd,but then there'll be like maybe two years in a row that we can't get anything.,,
sd,"Now that's, I mean, that's something that grows like a weed here.",,
ba,"Oh, wow.",,
sd^r,"I mean, it grows like a weed.",,
sd,"We have to allow extra room for those, because, you know, I mean extra space",,
b,Yeah,,
sd,because they take up a lot.,,
+,between the rows and all.,,
%,Yes,,
sd,"but I mean, we usually get",,
sd@,"if we plant, for every one plant we probably get fifty to sixty cucumbers off of it.",,
ba,Holy smoke.,,
+,"I mean, just pulling them as fast as you can.",,
sd,We usually give them to everybody.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,Anybody that wants a cucumber can have it.,,
sd,"But we tried it, too, where you run it up a fence",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"and, um, we had some weird cucumbers because they grew inside the fence.",,
sd,I mean like the little thing would be half on one side and half on the other.,,
ba,Oh my gosh.,,
sd,"I mean, it was",,
sd,"but they're so heavy, you know",,
sd,they get so heavy they kind of weigh it down.,,
sd,"But, I mean, cucumbers here grow like crazy.",,
b,Wow.,,
sd,Of course it's real hot here too.,,
sd,"Well, see, tomatoes grow like crazy at our house.",,
sd,Like we have a section of tomatoes,,
sd,"and we put the tomatoes there every year, in the same section.",,
sd,And I swear we get tomatoes six rows up.,,
b,Yeah,,
b^r,yeah,,
sd,"now if we have any, like the birds will pick or something, you know",,
sd,and some of the seeds drop.,,
qy,Have you ever had them just come up in different places ?,,
ny,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"I know, we do that, too, you know",,
sd,and at the first year,,
sd,because I was from the city when we got married,,
sd,"and the first year that we planted, I couldn't figure out, I mean, the",,
sd,"well, the first year after",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"I mean, we planted them",,
sd,"but the first year, you know, after we'd had a crop",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,all these little things like,,
sd,"we had cucumbers coming up, you know, in the middle of our okra",,
sd,"and I thought, how did this get here",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,I know I didn't put that seed there.,,
sd,"And it was weird, but the birds had, you know, evidently just deposited them for us.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"Well, sometimes, too, when we take out our garbage",,
sd,"and we usually, you know, we just dump it in the middle of the garden, you know, after your garden's basically done",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,and we're finding out,,
sd,"like we have peach trees in the middle of our garden now, because we took peach seeds and dump them there, whenever the garden",,
sd,like in the Fall,,
sd,now we have peach trees coming up,,
o,All right,,
ad,do you want to start out ?,,
aa,"Well, it'll be real easy for us",,

sv,"There's very few places that you, I'll bet that you could, uh",,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,"I think maybe if you were somewhere like California, where they have a lot more vegetarian restaurants",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,"But here, basically, you go to an Italian restaurant or you go to a Mexican restaurant",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

b,Uh-huh.,,

b,Yeah.,,
sd,So that would be one way of doing it.,,

sd,"Well, you should never give the social security number.",,
sd,"Uh, if sometimes, if you charge",,
sd,sometimes I charge theater tickets,,

b,Yes.,,
sd,"Uh, and occasionally I do order things from catalogs",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

qy,Is that why you picked the school you did,,

b,Yeah.,,
+,when they're home.,,
%,"They, um",,
sd,I just have one son who's in kindergarten,,
sd,"so in the morning they will like to watch like, um, EUREKA 'S CASTLE, it's called.",,
sd,It's just like a SESAME STREET,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,show,,
sd,"but, and they watch a couple of shows like that",,
sd,but I don't watch any daytime T V at all.,,
b,Yeah,,
aa,no,,
%,I don't,,
%,"And, uh",,
sd,"I guess, uh, there's some, uh, things on Channel Thirteen that I watch pretty regularly.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"On Saturdays they have, uh, a variety of things, uh",,
sd,and a lot of times I record it and watch it some other time.,,
sd,"But, uh",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"they have programs on, uh, house repairs and",,
%,Um.,,
+,how to build things,,
sd,"and, um, they have a calligraphy show",,
sd,"and I do calligraphy, so, I watch that.",,
ba,"Oh, that's nice.",,
sd,"And, um, they have a lot of cooking shows",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And, oh, you know, I'll just short of have it on sometimes to just sort of pick up little tidbits from those.",,
sd,"I don't sit and watch them but, but I enjoy some of it and especially if I'm, uh, cooking on a Saturday evening or something",,
sd,"and one of those is on, it kind of inspires me.",,
ba,That sounds like a good idea.,,
sd,"I notice that, um, since we moved here that we, we did get the cable T V",,
sd,"and when the newspaper comes out on Sunday, I sometimes read through the movies that will be listed",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,and I record some.,,
sd,"And then, uh, we have just totally cut down",,
sd,and we never go to like a video tape rental anymore because there's always plenty of things that we can record and then,,
b,Yeah.,,
+,"and watch and then record over it, something else.",,
sd,And so that's been really nice because if you decide one evening you would like to stay home and have a quiet evening and watch a movie then you have two or three saved.,,
b,Yeah,,
sd,we do some of that,,
sd,"In fact, I probably am more interested in watching some of the movies that are on T V",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"than, you know, other kinds of things.",,
sd,"Well, that's probably what I watch most frequently besides like news programs is the movies",,
sd,and they have a couple of channels that are like nostalgic older movies,,
b,Yes.,,
+,that I have really enjoyed that I'm seeing for the first time.,,
b,Yeah.,,
+,Like the MARX BROTHERS and things like that.,,
b,Yeah,,
sv,those are pretty good,,
sd,"I, I like those old ones",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,much better than some of the new stuff.,,
b,Right.,,
sd,"And so we, we have really enjoyed that",,
sd,and it's really nice not to be running out.,,
sd,Some of the video rentals can be expensive,,
%,and,,
b,Yeah.,,
^2,"And, boy",,
^2,the movie can be unbelievable.,,
b,Uh-huh,,
b,right.,,
sd,Going and paying six dollars for a ticket for one person at the theater or something.,,
%,So we,,
%,I have,,
sd,and it's so convenient at home,,
sd,"and you can do it anytime y-, you take the notion.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"And so, I have really enjoyed that",,
%,"but, but there are",,
sd,I do have friends that watch programs,,
sd,like they want to see a particular program and they are either home watching it or definitely recording it.,,
sd,They have some programs that they won't miss.,,
b,Uh-huh,,
sd,I'm not that hung up to most things.,,
sd,I mean if I miss something big deal.,,
b,Yes.,,
sv,"Well, and things are repeated",,
b,Yeah.,,
ba,That's true.,,
+,"so often that you know if, if I have seen just a program once chances are it'll be that exact same show.",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,if I ever decide to tune it in again,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,the only one I've ever seen and it'll be showing again.,,
sv,Pretty funny.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"But, uh, T V is something that we try an-, to not, um, deliberately try not to get hung up on it",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,like you say.,,
sd,We do too.,,
sd,Too many other things to do and too much going on.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And we don't want our kids to, to grow up thinking that that's what you do with your",,
b,Right.,,
+,spare time.,,
aa,Right.,,
aa,I agree.,,
sd,"So it's a little bit, something that we try doing",,
sd,"and there's, there's a lot of good children's programs that you could watch they could watch several hours every day.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And you could say, oh, that's a good program for them because it's educational",,
sd,but still you want them to go out and do other things.,,
sd,Even if they're,,
b,Right.,,
+,good programs you don't want them sitting there watching them.,,
b,Yeah.,,
o,Anyway. Well,,
b,Okay.,,

ny,Yeah,,

ny,yeah.,,
bk,Oh okay.,,
b,Yeah,,
b,Okay,,
sv,well,,
sd,that's the first thing I thought of,,
h,I don't know.,,
+,"Um. Well, I think it's caused a lot of, you know, big difference between when people had gone to war before",,
b,Right.,,
+,like compared to Vietnam,,
sv,because,,
b,Right.,,
+,"I mean, I know that there was so much more support for the soldiers going over",,
sv,and even people that didn't agree with the war still seem to be able to separate that,,
b,Right,,
%,and,,
+,"you know, and support the soldiers",,
%,so.,,
sd,"I know that, uh, I've heard people say that you know when people that went to World War Two",,
sd,you couldn't become a political figure or president unless you had served in the war,,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,"but then in Vietnam that was totally different, you know",,
sv,you couldn't be a political figure if you were in Vietnam probably.,,
b,Yeah,,
sv,And now,,
b,yeah.,,
+,"if you've served in Desert Storm you probably would be a, a good candidate.",,
aa,Yes,,
sv,it would be like a bonus for your,,
ba,E-,,
+,image or something.,,
+,"exactly, exactly.",,
b,Yeah,,
%,", it",,
sv,I'm sure it caused a lot of changes in terms of how many families had to have their income,,
^2,"Oh, torn apart.",,
%,"Oh, yea-",,
+,just drastically altered.,,
sd,"We had people down the street that the guy was in the reserves and he was just about ready to go and they have a, just had a new baby",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"and, uh, they would have, she would have had to go back to work",,
sd,and,,
b,Right.,,
+,I think she said their income would have dropped by like two thirds.,,
%,So it,,
sv,"that's also a good reason why it, it",,
sv,or good that it ended as soon as it did.,,
b,Yeah,,
b^r,yeah.,,
sv,"I think the biggest change that we've seen, um, in, in my life or whatever lately is the economy",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+@,and,,
sv,"things are so tight, and",,
sd,like my husband hasn't gotten a raise in two years and,,
ba,Exactly,,
+,you know.,,
sv,"and it seems like everything is raising, every-, everything that can be, cigarettes",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,"not that I smoke, but cigarettes, um, uh, stamps",,
sv,I mean it seems like ever-,,
sv,Even dog licenses,,
%,I mean,,
aa,Exactly,,
sv,everything single thing that we do,,
b,Yeah.,,

b,Yeah.,,
sd,you know. And they just raised the minimum wage today,,
sv,"but that's not like, you know",,
^2,Going to effect too many,,
+,as much as they should have raised it I'm sure.,,
b,Yeah,,
b^r,yeah.,,
%,"But, uh",,
sd,"So, that's the hardest thing for us",,
sd,"and, um, we've been trying to kind of maintain traditional lifestyle in the sense of meaning home.",,
sd,We have a three year old and a two year old,,
sd,and I'm trying to stay home as long as I can,,
b,Right.,,
sd,"but, you know, every week it gets harder",,
sd,because I could go out and be making money,,
b,Right.,,
b^r,Right.,,
sd,"you know, so that's a big, uh, stress I think",,
b,Yeah.,,

sd,"I don't, I don't have any children or anything right now",,
sd,"I'm, uh, I work as a news reporter in Waco",,
b,Oh,,
%,and so,,
b,I see.,,
sd,I get to see,,
sd,"I got to see a lot of not firsthand but, uh, probably a good part of the war, um, as far as what people thought about it",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,and a lot of things like that,,
%,so.,,
b,Yeah,,
b^r,yeah.,,
%,Well i-,,
sd,It was kind of amazing,,
sd,"people were coming to me to ask me, you know, what's going on, you know, like I knew",,
+,or like I sat in on the meetings or something.,,
b,Yeah,,
bf,you have an inside track or something.,,
aa,Yeah,,
aa^2,yeah.,,
sd,"So, I got to hear a lot of what the people thought about, you know, changes in, in the war and everything",,
sv,so that was pretty interesting.,,
b,Yeah,,
b^r,yeah.,,
^h,Let's see,,
t1,"what other social changes in the past ten years, oh",,
sd,I guess between men and women I've seen a lot of changes,,
b,Yeah.,,
+,"in terms of women feeling like they have to have a career, be mom, be",,
aa,Exactly,,
^2,"be everything, be supermom",,
+,"everything, superperson.",,
aa@,exactly.,,
b,Yeah,,
sd,"because I know, you know, I, I really get pressure from, because I have a career also",,
+@,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"and I get a lot of pressure from people that, you know, my colleagues",,
%,that,,
sd,why am I staying home. You know,,
b,Right.,,
%,And,,
sv,whereas before that never would have happened,,
sv,Whereas it would have been,,
sv(^q),"people would have said, why are you going to work.",,
aa,"Exactly, um.",,
sv,"So, that's kind of a difference for us.",,
sv,"I think there's more pressure to, um, not necessarily a negative thing but on my husband to be more involved with the family.",,
b,Right.,,
%,So he's,,
sv,The roles are changing a lot.,,
b,Yeah,,
sd,"he's gotten a lot, uh, you know",,
sv,you see all kinds of men being involved in the housework and taking care of the kids and all,,
sd,"but in terms of his amount of hours at work, nothing on that has lightened up.",,
b,Right.,,
sd,"So, it's now he has the pressure too of being superdad and supercareer",,
%,and,,
sv,"And even, you know, I think a lot of the movies we see now kind of, kind of play a good part in our changes",,
sd,"because, you see that they have THE THREE MEN AND A BABY type movies.",,
aa,Yeah,,
ba,that's true,,
sv,"And I think, you know that",,
sd,MISTER MOM,,
%,and,,
b,yeah,,
sd,"and then you have the women, uh, detectives now and, you know, different roles",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
%,just in what we see,,
sv,and so we probably want to do that even more now.,,
b,Yeah,,
b^r,yeah.,,
+,"You know since the women's movement in the, wh-, seventies",,
ba,That's true.,,
sv,"and, you know, we've come a long way but I think it's still a, still have a good ways to go.",,
b,Yeah.,,
b^r,Yeah.,,
%,So,,
%,I think there's still,,
sd,"I, I know that, um, I grew up in Chicago in the sixties",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
%,and was part,,
sd,my family was real liberal,,
sv,"and I think there's a lot of, um, kind of myths that we've come a long way just in terms of our society",,
b,Right.,,
+,and race relations and things like that,,
sv,"and, you know, I think there's so much prejudice still there",,
b,Yeah.,,
x,and,,
sv,it's kind of more covert now. People,,
sv,used to be more clear and say,,
aa,Exactly.,,

aa^r,Exactly.,,
sv,"and now, you know, I think there's still tremendous amount of prejudice",,
%,It's just not as,,
sv,"but people think, oh, we're in the nineties, we're beyond all that, you know.",,
aa,Exactly.,,
%,But it's,,
sv,"I mean like I say, we've come a long way, but we have, I mean, twice as far to go",,
b,Yeah,,

b^r,yeah.,,
sv,"and I don't think a lot of people, you know, realize a lot, the plight of a lot of people.",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,"You know, and you may be in good standing and everything may look hunky-dory to you",,
^2,But there's so many more people,,
+,but there's so many more people,,
+,that are homeless,,
%,and,,
+@,"exactly, that you don't even",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,and that you don't even see or know about.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,It's real easy to get isolated in your own little community,,
ba,"Oh, oh, yeah.",,
sd,"you know, because wh-, when I was growing up in Chicago, um, we were in a real ethnic neighborhood",,
sd,"and there were people from all, first generation Chinese, German, you know all different nationalities",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,and everything.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And now we're kind of like in Lewisville, Miss White Little suburbia",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,you know.,,
sd,I mean I don't even know anybody that,,
b,Yeah.,,
+,"you know, from any place other than Texas hardly",,
sd,I grew up in,,
+,you know.,,

ba,"Oh, boy.",,
sd,"and so I was just, I was just surrounded, you know, by Black people",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,because I'm Black,,
sd,"and so, you know I lived, that's where I lived.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"And so now, I, I feel lucky actually because I've almost lived around everyone.",,
sd,"I've, I went to U T to college",,
b,Oh.,,
sd,"and so they, you know, they have a lot of different people go there",,
b,Yeah.,,

sd,And so I feel really enriched in that a lot of people don't get to see,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"you know, some people have lived in Lewisville all their life, you know",,
b,Yeah,,
sv,and they,,
+,and so they don't get to see,,

ba,Exactly. And th-,,
sd,We lived in a dorm.,,
sd,My husband and I met in graduate school,,

sd,they're graduate students from all over the world.,,
sd,And once we came here it was like,,
^h,gosh,,
sd,I just miss that,,
ba,Exactly.,,
sv,because it really is exciting,,
aa,It is.,,

sd,We got invited to,,

b,Yeah,,
b,really.,,

%,"Well, I, uh",,
sd,several years ago a radio broke in my car,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,and I never,,
sd,I got out of the habit of listening to the radio,,
sd,and so I haven't been listing,,
sd,"I, I used to just listen to the rock stations",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"but, um, lately I have been going back to classical music.",,
sd,"I don't really know what too many of the most popular songs are unless, you know, they're in the, the news or something.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"But, um, so I tend to listen to some of the older songs that were popular back when I was paying attention.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,And then I like some classical music,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,and some of the pieces that have been around a while.,,
sd,I haven't paid much attention to most of the current music.,,
qo,What about you ?,,
sd,"Um, I listen, I listen to a wide variety of music.",,
sd,Sometimes I'll turn on the classical music,,
sd,sometimes I'll listen to jazz,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"uh, every now and then country and western.",,

sd,"I also like the, uh, the, the classic rock stations",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,"Um, some of the, some of the rock stations now are the, I guess the top forty stations or whatever.",,
%,They just,,
sd,it really gets on my nerves because they play so many commercials,,
sv,and,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,sometimes the deejays are just kind of annoying and irritating,,
ba,That's true.,,
sv,and it gets kind of old,,
sv,and they play the same songs over and over,,
sd,and I just get kind of tired of all that.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,So lots of times,,

sd,"But, uh, most of my cassettes",,
sd,"I guess, I don't, I don't like hard rock.",,
b,No.,,
sd,"Um, I have some, some rock and some jazz and a couple, maybe one or two country and western. Some, uh, oh, I can't believe I can't think of his name. Um, Garth Brooks",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,I have a couple of his tapes.,,
sd,"And, um, but it's mainly, it's mainly just the, the light rock type stuff.",,

sd,I never liked any of the heavy metal,,

b,Uh-huh.,,
%,"But, and I",,
sd,"back a long time ago, when the rap music first came out",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

b,Uh-huh.,,
%,"but I, you know",,
sv,now that there's just a million rap groups,,
sv,and,,

b,"Oh, yeah.",,
sd,"and, so I, you know, I'm not attracted to that at all",,
sd,"but, um, it made a big difference in my life not to have a radio that was MUMBLEx easy access",,
sd,"and so now that I do have one, I just don't automatically turn it on",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,unless there's something I'm particularly listening to.,,
sv,"But, you know, if you go two or three years without having that",,
sd,what I got the most exposure to,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"it really changed my life-style and kept me from just having a, you know, easy access to current music",,

"sd,qy^g","But we don't have a C D yet, do you ?",,

b,Uh-huh.,,

b^r,yeah.,,

b,Yeah,,

ba,Sure,,
sv,and also they get better quality,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
%,w-,,
sv,and they learn to have more features and things and,,
b,Uh-huh.,,

b,Yeah,,

o,Take our time.,,
b,Right.,,

b,Uh-huh.,,

b,Yeah,,
sd,"see, I've got a, on my stereo I've got a, a, uh, turntable, and then I've got a dual cassette",,
sd,so I can record off other cassettes.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,But I never realized you couldn't record onto C-,,
sd,I just never really thought about it,,
sd,because I haven't really looked into it very much.,,
sd,I don't have one,,
%,and,,
b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,I just got mine paid off.,,
ad,Enjoy it.,,
sd,"I'm going to stick with the cassettes and, and, uh, you know, until, until they",,
sd,"now my sister, my younger sister has a, she does have a C D player that she got for Christmas",,

b,Uh-huh.,,
%,Um,,
ba,"Well, that's good.",,
sd,"so I can record some things from her and, you know, get cassettes and record off other ones or off the radio if I want to",,
sd,but,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"but, uh, I just haven't gone to C D yet.",,
sd,"Why, we haven't either",,
sd,"but we, you know, we like the, the idea of having great extra quality, you know",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,in your music and things.,,
sd,"But, but I'm satisfied to just have what I've been used to, not have to think about the great financial",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"sacrifice that that would be, to suddenly try to switch over to all C D -s or something.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"But I know one thing that has colored my music choice is when we had children, um, I really started to think about what kind of television programs I was watching",,
b,Right.,,
+,and what kind of music I was listening to and,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,activities,,
sd,"because, um, you know, I just didn't want them to be exposed to a lot of things",,

b,"Oh, yeah",,
x,.,,
+,I just wasn't pleased with,,
sd,"And they get worse and worse, too.",,

b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,And so I really think we've tried to tone down,,
b,Uh-huh.,,

b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"Well, that's amazing how I used to, when I was in college, I used to have the stereo on all the time or I had on M T V or something",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,"Now I, I will turn on",,
sd,I've got a small jam box in my bathroom.,,
sd,I'll turn that on while I'm in the shower and while I'm getting ready because there's really not much else I can do,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"and it's kind of boring standing there, putting on makeup, so I'll turn the radio on",,
sd,and,,
b,Right.,,
+,"and then I listen to it when I'm in the car driving to work because, again, there's, you know, there's nothing else going on.",,
sd,I might as well listen to the radio while I'm driving to work.,,
b,Right.,,
sd,"But other than that, I've, I really don't, I don't listen to the radio or even to my albums or cassettes or anything very often anymore.",,
sd,I guess I'm just too busy doing other things that it's too much trouble to get up and go decide what I want to listen to,,

b,Yes,,
sd,I know what you mean.,,
sd,"I, I know my husband, he, um, plays an instrument",,
sd,and he played in the band when he was in college and in high school,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,and so he has a lot of all different kinds of music,,
sd,and he goes out of his way to play marching band music,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"or like you say, jazz or classical to the children to, to give them some exposure to different kinds of music.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,And I think that's really good because they're learning to like all different kinds,,
%,and,,
ba,That's good.,,
qw,What instrument does he play ?,,

b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,I never had known anyone to play one before.,,
b,Uh-huh,,
sd,I've never heard of that.,,
sd,"But it's kind of like a small, small tuba but it's not the kind that sits up on your shoulder.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"But it's a cross between a tuba and, and an, and, you know, a horn.",,
sd,It's a brass instrument.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,and,,
b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,and he thinks that would be good for the kids.,,
b,Uh-huh,,
sv,"oh, I'm sure it is.",,
sv^r,I'm sure it is.,,

%,I,,
sd,my parents had me take piano lessons for eight years,,
b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,but then I got interested in a lot of other things,,
sd,and I got real involved in many things,,
sd,"and, and now I don't have a piano in my apartment or anything.",,
sd,I could sit back down and play a few things,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,but not like I used to be able to.,,
sv,It's kind of sad that I've let that slip away.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And I took guitar lessons, I think, for one or two years",,

sd,They're like all white,,
sd,and their starting guard had S A T scores of fifteen hundred.,,

b,"Oh, yeah.",,
sd,"And, uh, somebody suggested to get a bass.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,And so they went fishing and caught a bass near some place and put it in there and never saw it again.,,
qy^d,Never saw the bass ?,,

b,Yeah.,,
sd,We still have lots of little goldfish.,,
sd,"They propagate pretty well, those little fish.",,
b,Yeah,,
b,Yeah,,
sd,they really do.,,
%,because we started,,
sd,we have got hundreds in there now,,

b,Uh-huh.,,

b,Oh,,
%,And,,
b,yeah.,,
%,It,,
%,They ha-,,
%,"there is a, uh",,
ad,"you might put some, like some yellow catfish in there.",,

sd,but they get huge.,,
sd,"And, uh, they routinely use them for bait for, uh, goldfish for bait",,

sd,"But catfish do, I think.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,They live in the Mississippi River all the way through Minnesota,,
b,Uh-huh.,,

%,"So, that",,
%,you mean,,
sd,"well, we could try it.",,
sv,That is a good idea.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"Because he was trying to catch them, you know, using little, uh, -h, -h",,

b,Uh-huh.,,
+,Minnow nets or something.,,
b@,Uh,,
sd,My father was taking those and trying to catch the goldfish.,,
sd,And it was really funny,,

sd,and he like would put some tuna fish or things in the middle of it to attract the fish.,,
+@,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And, uh, he left it in the middle of the pond.",,

b,Uh-huh.,,
%,And so,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,That is what happens.,,
qy,But do you guys have fishing competitions while you are there ?,,
ny,Yeah,,

ny,Yeah.,,

b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,And you could catch a couple anyway,,
qw,What,,

b,Yeah.,,
ba,That is funny.,,
sd,But they come up to the top.,,

%,And,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,they're,,
sd,"the ca-, the big catfish just kind of vacuum the top of the water.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"I have never seen catfish, you know, except in fi-, filleted on a plate, I think maybe.",,
sd,I think I have seen once or twice in like the museum.,,

sd,But I have never seen them,,

sd,That would be fun to see.,,
ba,"Well, they are really funny fish.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

b,Uh-huh.,,

qw,How big do they get ?,,

qw@,Okay. But how long in feet ?,,

qy,Do you know ?,,

sd,and I actually do research in speech recognition,,
ba,"Oh, great.",,
sd^t,MUMBLEx part of the reason I'm participating in the project,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,is to see how the stuff goes.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"But, um, I was working",,
sd,"well, actually I haven't worked for any large companies per se",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"uh, recently",,
sd,but hopefully the job that I will have will have lots of benefits,,
b,Uh-huh.,,

b,Yeah,,
x,.,,
+,not real good salary but lots of vacations.,,
sd,"Well, the one John works for seems to have a l-, you know, good benefits",,
sd,and the pay is decent.,,
b,Yeah,,
%,"the, uh",,
sd,"well actually, where I was working the company",,
sd,one of the companies I was working for actually had very good health care benefits,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,which these days I think are really important,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,because health care is so ridiculously expensive.,,
%@,Uh.,,
sd,"Because we're, we're paying our own insurance right now.",,
+@,Uh-huh,,
b^r,uh-huh,,
b^r,uh-huh.,,

sd,we actually had a little baby,,
b,Oh,,
+,so I'm taking a little bit of a time off from work.,,
ba,Great,,
sd,"I had, I had a granddaughter.",,
ba,"Oh, congratulations.",,
sd,And so one thing that I'm very concerned with now is first of all health benefits,,
sd,because it's more important with a family,,
b,Right.,,
sd,"and you know, our doctor's vi-, routine doctor's visits covered",,
sd,"my health insurance only covers, um, the emergency care.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
qy,Do you have major medical benefits ?,,
na,"Right, yeah",,
sd,but I don't,,
sv,"That, that helps some",,
%,if,,
sv,it depends on what your deductible is,,
b,Right.,,
+,how high it is.,,
%,"Well, my",,
sd,our deductible's five hundred,,
sd,but it's for each,,
^2,Each person.,,
+,event.,,
aa,Yeah,,
sd,"that's pretty har-, that's pretty high",,
b,Right,,
sd,"but, you know, so it covers the emergency things but it doesn't cover if you get sick",,
b,Right.,,
sd,it doesn't cover,,
ba,"That's, that's right.",,
+,"doctor's visits, things like that.",,
sd,And five hundred dollars is a lot to come up with for each person to be able to start using your,,
aa,"Oh, yeah",,
sd,it certainly is.,,
+,"major medical, too.",,
%,Uh.,,
b,Yeah,,
sd,I know where my daughter works,,
%,"now she, she",,
sd,"course we live in a, a rural sort of setting",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,and where she works she has no benefits at all.,,
ba,Wow.,,
sd,"And her wage is not, not very good.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"But it's, it's the type of area we live in.",,
sd,"Of course, living expenses aren't as bad either, though, which makes a difference.",,
sv,"And probably the medical care is less expensive, too.",,
sd,"Well, she has to pay for it herself",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"you know, they have to pay for their own insurance.",,
%,"But, uh",,
sd,So I think that in general the doctor's fees are probably lower there,,
sd,and so the insurance would cost lower,,
sd,"Uh, well, from what I've seen",,
sd,from my aunt and uncle really from Florida up to here,,
sd,they're not that much different.,,
sd,"Well, I know that friends of mine had a baby up in Boston",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,and their costs were about fifty percent of what it cost to have it in Manhattan.,,
bh,Is that right ?,,
sd,"And they were at one of the better hospitals, you know",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"and, you know, good doctors in Boston.",,
ba,Wow,,
ba,that's a big difference.,,
sd,And I was at one of the big hospitals in New York.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,But that's a huge difference just between,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"you know, and it's two big cities that I think of as somewhat comparable.",,
aa,"Oh, yeah",,
sv,should be.,,
sd,So I was pretty shocked at that.,,
sd,But the other thing that I'm really concerned about,,
sd,and most companies don't have,,
sd,"some are starting to have, is day care",,
b@,Yes. Uh-huh.,,
sd,"because it would be really nice to be able to have, you know, someone that could watch my daughter at work.",,
sd,And I'd go to work,,
sd,"and if she were sick I could go down and see her, if she needs to be fed, whatever.",,
^2,And it would be much more convenient.,,
b,Yeah,,
%,And I,,
^2^r,"it would be more convenient, too.",,

+,I think,,
sd,My other daughter works and has,,

b,Uh-huh.,,
%,"And, uh, it, it's",,
sd,I don't know how they do it,,
sd,I really don't. You know,,
sd,"getting them there and then, and going to work, and then picking them up and",,
^2,"And, and your hours are",,
+,all the preparations.,,
+,much more constrained and things like that.,,
b,Uh-huh,,
b^r,uh-huh.,,
%,"And, that, to me, well, that, you know",,
sv,"those three things, the health care, vacation, and day care",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,are probably the most important benefits.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"I suppose I should be concerned with life insurance and, uh, retirement plans",,
%,but,,
h,"Oh, I don't know",,
sv,"I think those benefits you mentioned, sometimes they're even more important than you-, the wage itself.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,"If you can get those benefits even, uh",,
sv,"they, they come out to much, a much better benefit than, than an increase in your wage a lot of times.",,
b,Right,,
%,"because you're, you know",,
sv,certainly something like day care at the work place,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,would make life so much simpler,,
b,Uh-huh,,
b^r,uh-huh.,,
+,"that it's worth paying, you know, having a lower salary.",,
sd,I would certainly accept a lower,,
b,"Oh, yeah.",,
+,salary for that.,,
aa,"Oh, yeah",,
sv,it would make it a lot better.,,
+,"You know, everything else being equal",,
sv,because your life would be so much easier.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,And there's a question of quality of life also.,,
sv,"Uh, well, and if it was there, you would really have a little more, uh, knowledge on what's going on",,

b,Uh-huh.,,
qy,Is that locally ?,,
ng,"Uh, Pittsburgh.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.",,
b,Yeah,,
sd,"because Pittsburgh's a big enough city, too.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"But you know, I wouldn't be surprised if thing's like that didn't happen more in smaller communities before they happen in bigger ones.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,Just because people might be more flexible in smaller locations and,,
b,Yeah,,
+,things like that.,,
sd,Because many times small companies offer better benefits in terms of quality of life than larger companies.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"Like, uh, one company had proposed to me that I could come back to work after having the baby, um, any where between ten and forty hours a week.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,"Oh, so they were very flexible",,
b,Yeah,,

b,Yeah,,

qy^d,Leaving it up to the judge ?,,
na,"We-, just, just sentencing, not the trial itself.",,
bk,"Oh, okay.",,
sv,"Um, because I think that th-, that, that judges are probably more informed as to what is",,
b,Yeah,,

b,well right,,
sv,because,,
+,and stuff like that,,
%,an,,
+,"the general public doesn't know that if, i-, if they're sentenced to life that they won't serve life.",,
b,Right.,,
sv,Course the judge will know when he'll be up for parole and all that.,,
b,So yeah,,
b,Right,,
sv,"so he'll be able to give them the maximum sentence, in some cases there.",,
b,Okay,,
sd^t,I must not have understood the whole thing,,

b,Oh yeah,,

sd^t,"they give that as, as an example of something that",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,But I think if the entire trial was left to one person,,
sd,I've got a four year old,,
sv,you can hear.,,
aa,Oh yes.,,
sd,"But, uh, I don't know",,
%,you,,
sv,"pe-, too many people can take vendettas out on people",,
b,Right.,,

b,Right,,
ba,but that's true.,,

%,"Someone says to you, you know",,
sd,"when they ask you if you, uh, if you want to be on, you know",,
sd,"when you're called for duty say oh yeah, I want to be on jury duty because I can spot a guilty person a mile a way.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,"They quickly let you off jury duty I hear, um.",,
b,Right,,
sv,"because they, they know that you're biased.",,
b,"Oh, yeah",,
sv,"that, that, that, that, that's, that's the way it works there, um.",,
%,"Anyway, I think that probably for, for having it",,
qh,"what about, you know, about being unanimous.",,
sv,"I mean, that's sort of a strange case because I wonder what happens when eleven people thinks someone's guilty and one person doesn't",,
sd,"one person thinks that, that they're not guilty",,
sv,"and they can't decide for hours, unless they convince that one person, you know.",,
qy,Does it have to be unanimous ?,,
na,"I believe it does have to be unanimous, actually.",,

qy,or do they.,,
ny,Yeah,,

b,No,,
sd,me neither.,,
sd,"So, I don't know much about that",,
sd,"I just know that, um.",,
%,I wonder,,
sd,'cause sometimes I think about it actually,,
sd,"I think well, what if I were that one person and I was completely convinced that, that, that, that this person wasn't guilty, you know.",,
sv,Well you don't have to be really convinced that he's guilty,,
sv,it's just if they can't prove he's guilty,,
%,because,,
b,"Right, uh",,
sd,"but, I mean what if eleven other people are saying one thing, you know, and you're",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,you're the one person saying the other thing.,,

b,Yeah,,
b^r,yeah.,,

sd,"I wonder about those things, you know, or even if it's, you know",,
sv,"I, I guess if they were to say, well it doesn't have to be unanimous",,

b,Uh-huh.,,
qh,"you know, how do you decide.",,

b,Yeah,,
sd,I've never quite understood that. Um.,,
sd,"Well I just think it's, it's weird because I've saw, well, of course, soap operas",,
sd,I'm an soap opera fanatic.,,
b,Okay.,,
sd,"This one guy had, uh, framed himself to make it",,
%,we-,,
%,which,,
sd,he really did kill the person,,
sd,but then he set it up where it looked like somebody was trying to frame him,,
sd,and he was on trial for it,,
sd,"and then, you know, it came out that he was being framed",,
sd,so then he was found not guilty,,

b,Right,,

b,Yeah,,

sd,I often wonder about that,,

qy^d,about that woman.,,
ny,Yeah.,,
%,W-,,
%,"so I wond, and then I wonder why that, you know",,
sv,"there, there must be some sort of deep seeded reason for that",,
sv,"yo-, you know, something like, something like, well you can't be tried for the same trial because that would bias the, the, the, the jury or something",,
%,"or, you know.",,
b,Right,,

sv,"when someone is, is on trial for something, you can't bring up prior convictions.",,
b,Right.,,
%,Which,,
sv,"like if they're on tr-, uh, trial for rape, you can't have any, you can't bring up the sexual assaults and stuff, or whatever.",,

b,Yeah,,
ba,"I know, if it's related",,
%,I wonder,,
sv,"if it's related to the crime, they should be able to.",,
b,Yeah,,
sv,"I mean if this man is, is accused of raping someone, then I think that something like sex, you know",,
b,Yeah.,,

b,Right,,

b,Yeah,,

sv,He needs to be annihilated.,,
b,Right,,
sd,"I mean, I don't know what you do with them at that point, if you're that crazy",,
sd,"but what, what struck me is, you know, they had a psychiatrist testifying for hours and hours",,
sv,"and by the end, I realized that maybe it would have been better if they had, it wouldn't have been a jury of his peers, but if they had a jury of psychiatrists instead, to sort look at it, you know.",,
b,Yeah.,,

qw,"what, what major changes have affected your life ?",,

%,Um,,
qr,"You mean yourself, or women in general ?",,
sd,"Well, women in general, and, and also myself.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"But, um, it used to not really make a difference to me, um",,

b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,"So I'm having to, uh, try to figure out a way to be able to do that.",,

sd,"because that relates to the thing that, that strikes me the most",,

ba,That's right,,
ba^r,that's right.,,

sv,Scary,,
sd,I just wish there was a way,,
sd,"I know that in, in, you know, in Sweden, what they have there, it's really their medical plan, but it also deals with this subject, because if a woman, uh, is working",,

b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,when we bought our home it was recently updated.,,

sd,so we didn't have to do any painting.,,
b,Right.,,
sd,"And the condominium we moved in before, my husband went over and painted",,
%,but I,,
sd,"the experience that I've had is that, um, whatever time he gave, said, Oh, it would take me about, just about four hours",,

sd(^q),"and he said, Well, all I got done was the taping around.",,
bh,Isn't that amazing ?,,
sd,"It, it looks so easy just slapping paint on.",,
sd,I had an addition put on,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"and, um, we, and I decided",,
+,because my inner room looked so dingy,,
+,because I put these beautiful French doors in,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"and, so I decided, okay, I'll just, you know, have them paint this little room, you know, a little ten by ten dining area.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,It took four days.,,
sd,And even the painter couldn't give me a good estimate.,,
sd,"He said, Well, I'll be done this afternoon, you know",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"and pretty soon, before you know it, you know, he's run into so many problems",,
%,and it's just,,
sd,there's nothing there to be a problem I thought,,
sd,"but, um, it just took him so much longer",,
sd,and,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,and he was there to paint the French doors also.,,
sd,"Um, and if you've ever painted French doors, which my husband just finally said he wasn't going to do",,
+,because it looked so formidable,,
b,Yeah.,,
ad,"Um, then, then just",,
sd,"we, we got this painter",,
sd,"and I just called him because I got a little ad out of the, you know, the adcose or whatever in the mail, and, uh, you know, just got this painter person over here.",,
sd(^q),"And he said, Yeah, I can finish it in a day.",,
fe,"Oh, right.",,
sd,so the whole project basically took a week.,,
ba,"Oh, I know",,
sd,it's just awful.,,
sd,Funny.,,
sd(^q),And I go what makes you a professional ? You know ?,,
^q,"How much, you know, more do you know than I know about this whole situation",,
sd,"but he just kept painting on those French doors, you know",,
sd,"and each little, um",,
^2,Pane.,,
+,"paint stroke, you know, the paint wasn't going on right is what it was.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"So he had to redo them like three times before I was happy with them, before he was happy, you know, that they even looked halfway decent",,
sd,and,,
%,Um.,,

sd,"I mean, hire a professional",,
sv,but that doesn't guarantee anything.,,
aa,No,,
%,and it really,,
sv,"like you said, always takes way longer than anyone, um, is able to guess, because I know my husband he, he painted, when he",,
sd,it was just the preparation time was so long.,,
b,Right.,,
+,"That when he actually got down to the painting part,",,
+,"he, it was like ten times longer than he already thought he would be done",,
sd,"and, and, uh, he did part of the, in the, at night because we were trying to hurry up and get it ready so we could move in",,
sd,"and, um, and he didn't notice until the next morning that the shades of paint between the two paint cans, he had finished one can off and started another one.",,
ba,"Oh, no.",,
sd,"And then we went in there, you know, one was, bu-",,
sd,they were white,,
sd,but one had more blue to it.,,
sv,"Oh, and that can make a difference",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,too.,,
sd,"I mean, and they bring the, uh, you know, little samples",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,but there are just so many tints upon tints upon tints,,

b,Uh-huh.,,
+,blue cast to it.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,And it looked awful on.,,
sd,So that was the next problem.,,
sd,He had to redo that too.,,
%,I,,
b,Yeah.,,
%,This was a,,
sd,"and it was a major project getting the money together to do it too, by the end",,
b,Right.,,
