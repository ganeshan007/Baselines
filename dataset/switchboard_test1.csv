sd,"Uh, what I was thinking more along the lines of is start going to space.",,
%,Huh.,,
qy^d,And that way just create more jobs or whatever ?,,
na,"Well, at some point there, there will be enough jobs for most of the ab-, able-bodied Americans.",,
bk,Huh.,,
ba,", well, that's a neat idea.",,
sv,"We also need to, uh, assure that there's some work in the private sector.",,
b,Yeah,,
%,"that's what, that's what",,
qy,"yo-, you think space would do that much for that",,
%,or,,
na,I think it would do something for it.,,
sv,I think we would fill up new technologies.,,
sv,But I think we should also do something rather radical.,,
qw^d,Like what ?,,
sd,Legalize marijuana.,,
qy,"Oh, you think, you think that would, uh, have a major effect ?",,
sv,"Well, that would put a lot of criminals out of business for a while anyway.",,
br,What ?,,
sv,"Th-, that might have a, uh, a good effect on, on, on crime anyway.",,
aa,"Yes, uh",,
^h,okay,,
sv,I think it would take some of that money out of the hands of criminals.,,
sv,"I think it would put, reduce the amount of carry on drug use where people advance from one drug to another.",,
ba,That's probably true.,,
sv,"I think that, I think most importantly it would give the federal government something new that they could tax.",,
sv,And probably a lot of.,,
sv^m,And probably a lot of,,
sv,and really receive some revenues from.,,
b,Yeah,,
%,but that's potentially,,
sv,"Uh, if you look at prohibition historically, it's repeal helped the federal government a lot in tax revenues.",,
b,"Uh-huh, huh.",,
%,No,,
sd,I had never thought about that.,,
sv,"Then I think once we put money back into the cof-, in the coffers of the federal government",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"and get the federal government to where there's money there again, we should reduce the amount of money",,
sv,"and this would have to come rather quickly, and would have to come originally also where we're not paying",,
sv,"in some cases we do pay more, for welfare recipients to live then they can earn in the true minimum wage environment.",,
ba,"That's true we do, often times they are paid more, yeah.",,
sv,And you can't deny people the right to supply their families better through whatever means.,,
b,Right.,,
sv,That's just sensible on their part.,,
br,That's just what on their part,,
fa,I'm sorry,,
sd,I missed that.,,
sv^r,It's just sensible on their parts,,
bk,Oh.,,
+,"to go after the, the, the greater amount of income.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"So, if you lower the amount they make and raise the amount of true minimum wage jobs, not those that are affected by the federal minimum wage, then more people will get off welfare.",,
b,"That, that maybe true.",,
ba,That's very true.,,
sv,"You know, give them a true incentive to want to work.",,
b,Right.,,
sv,And then don't start letting more outsiders in for a few years until we figure out exactly where we're at with unemployment.,,
b,Right,,
%,that's a,,
sv,Reduce immigration,,
%,Huh.,,
+,"or eliminate it entirely for a few years, until we get our own house in order.",,
b,Yeah,,
sv,"and maybe even reduce, al-, along the same lines, maybe reduce imports as well, I think.",,
aa,"Oh, absolutely",,
aa^r,absolutely.,,
sv@,I mean MUMBLEx. We don't need to buy other people's stuff right now MUMBLEx.,,
ba,That's right,,
sv,"when we're in a world of hurt, well, I don't, I'm not going to say that we ought to re, reduce them through legal means.",,
sv,I think we ought to just tax them severely.,,
b,Right,,
sd,"well, that, that's what happened in other country though.",,
sv,And other places they tax us quite ha-,,
sv,"I mean, they tax American imports quite heavily.",,
sv,"So, we could do the same thing",,

%,"and, you know, they may get",,
sv,It seems only fair.,,
b,Right,,
aa,it does seem only fair,,
qh,"I mean, why not.",,
sv,"And I think really if we got all those that are able-bodied into the work force reduced the amount going out for those purposes, created new jobs for that work force, there would be plenty of money.",,
aa,I think so.,,
sv,And then at that point,,
b,Yes.,,
+,quit spending on space.,,
%,Oh real,,
sv,"Force it all into the, into the private sector.",,
sd,"Oh, really I love the switch.",,
sv,"Well, at that point you might, we, i-, i-, it wouldn't be a problem anymore possibly, you know",,
sv,we would be,,
ba,That's right.,,
+,we would be able to keep it wherever we wanted to in space or the ocean research whatever we wanted to do,,
%,but I think the,,

b,Right.,,
+,a lot of,,
sd,Millspec and NASA work operates to the same demanding specifications,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,that would put a bunch of defense workers back to work.,,
b,Right,,
^2,compared to defense.,,
sv,"Well, that's a good idea.",,
%,"Well, it",,
sv,"well, the other thing, and the other thing I, I, I think we seriously need to do is, um, like I say, have someone go in and look and, you know, and find out where it is we're paying ten thousand dollars per toilet seat or something.",,

b,Right,,
%,"well, that's a",,
sd,I had never heard that before.,,
sv,"Uh, a huge amount of what you hear on, about the seventy-five dollar hammers",,

^h,how can I say it ?,,
sd,"Um, over like in Poland, uh, where my father-in-law lived for years there their health care system is, um",,
sd,because no financial gains are available for doctors.,,
sd,"Uh, they may just go into being a doctor just clearly just to be a doctor for the full reason",,
sd,but most people that go in to being a physician here in the U S do it for financial gain.,,
+@,Yeah.,,
sd(^q),"They say, well, jeez. If I get into this area of dermatology, I don't have to do this",,
^q,I can do this,,

sv,or plastic surgery,,
^2,"or, uh, if I become a, uh, heart specialist I'm going to make this kind of money, uh",,

b,Yeah.,,
+,when you have a universal system.,,
b^r,Yeah.,,
sv,"Um, the only way they could do that is by having a real good quality check, um, and also offering some kind of",,
sv,"because I think, uh, all physicians, well, anybody, um, likes the ability to kind of, uh, get themselves financially, uh, situated.",,
sv,"Uh, I guess that's the whole U S concept",,
b,Right.,,
+,is to come here and,,
sv,More motivation.,,
b,Yeah,,
sv,and I don't know if you can have that with a universal system.,,
sv,"Maybe, you know, there's a way of working that out",,
sd,but I know that in Poland in particular the doctors just go to do their job and that's it.,,
sd,That's what they look at it as.,,
b,Yeah.,,
%,"There's no, uh",,

b,Right.,,

sv,"I mean you hear about people, you know, six and seven times have committed burglaries",,
sv,"and they're still, you know, only serving six months in prison.",,

qy,are you a student,,
qrr,or are you in the work force,,

na,"Um, I'm a senior at Clarion University.",,
bk,"Oh, okay.",,

sd,"And apparently many of the, especially like in date rape, many of the, uh, you know, perpetrators seem to be getting off because the universities kind of cover up.",,
sv,Well,,
sd,And they don't really,,

qy,You know,,
ba,Wow.,,

sd,A lot of times,,
ny,Yeah.,,

b,Yeah.,,
sd,They say like only one in ten are reported.,,
sv,I believe it.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
ba,That's awful.,,
sv,So one thing they could do is probably support people more reporting it.,,
sd,I know some police agencies try to have women police officers that the women can report to and this kind of thing.,,
sv,"But I'm sure it's still terribly traumatizing, you know, for people to report it.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,So that's probably something else they could do.,,
b,Yeah.,,
h,I don't know,,
sv,it seems like something else in terms of crime is certainly involved with drugs,,
+,you know.,,
%,And that's like as long as,,
sd,"it almost makes me feel, in a way, like making drugs legalized just to get all the money out of it and not have, you know",,
sv(^q),because these kids are saying why should I go to high school,,
^q,"and so I can go out and work at Burger King, you know, for four dollars an hour or whatever, when I can make four hundred dollars a day selling drugs.",,
sv,So that's certainly a big problem.,,
sv,I don't know what the solution to that is.,,
sv,Having more drug treatment centers available.,,
h,"Jeez, I don't know.",,
sv,"Uh. See, you see now I would say that that's a bigger problem up here than even the date rape or anything.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,I know a lot of people that partake in that.,,
sd,And I'm not saying they're bad people,,
sv,"but I, I, I would say that's a bigger problem.",,
b,Yeah.,,
%,Because it ends up,,
sv,"even if it's just kind of like this social drug use, you're still ending up supporting these big drug pin, you know",,
sv,"huge amounts, thousand and millions and millions of dollars are getting spent, you know, on higher and higher up",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,on drugs,,
sv,and it's definitely got to do with crime.,,
sv,"You know, you hear about people selling their babies, you know, to get some crack.",,
%,"I mean, just, oh",,
sv,"gosh, horrible stuff like that.",,
sd,"One of the things they're doing is, is they're prosecuting the women who are having these kids that are addicted to crack.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"They said, uh, some of the statis-, statistics show like one out of every ten babies being born in these public hospitals are addicted to crack",,
sd,and their moms are crack users.,,
sv,"So that's, you know, another way of looking at it is as the woman is being a criminal, you know, for doing that to her child.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,So I don't know who's the victim there.,,
sv,"I mean the kids are the victim, it seems like a lot of times the women are victims because they're addicted.",,

qy,You mean it's stronger there ?,,
ny,"Uh, oh, yeah",,
ny^r,yeah.,,
ba,Much stronger.,,
sv,"And, and I think that, uh, you know, career women still have a lot of problems here",,

b,Yeah,,
b^r,yeah.,,
sv,That's the woman's role,,
ba,Yes.,,
sv,"and it, and it's hard for her to, uh, you know, watch her peers be appreciated, I think sometimes",,
h,but then I'm not there,,
h,so I don't know that.,,
b,Yeah,,
b^r,yeah.,,
sd,And I have women that do both,,
sd,"and I see a little jealousy on the part of, you know, the woman what has two little boys",,
sd,"and, and she has an au pair, which is a live-in college kid working for her",,
sd,and then she has her business in the back,,
%,Uh.,,

b,Uh-huh,,
b^r,uh-huh,,

b,Yeah,,

aa,so. You're right about that.,,

b,Right.,,
%,Uh.,,
ad,Go ahead.,,
qh,"So Ken, how do you do your family budget ?",,
sd,"Well, we don't actually have a budget, budget per se.",,

b,Huh-uh.,,

sd,"And, um, we also, we, um, we have a, a U S Air and Visa card.",,
b,Huh-uh.,,
sd,"Every, every dollar we, every dollar we charge is a mile for our frequent flier mileage.",,
b,"Oh, yeah.",,
sd,"It's a real good deal actually, if you charge a lot.",,
sd,"So what we, what my wife and I have taken to doing is charging everything in sight.",,
sd,"Anything we buy, we charge, including groceries and so forth.",,
b,Huh-uh.,,
sd,So what we'll do is,,
qy^2,"Well, then you just pay it off at the end of the month ?",,
na,Right.,,
sd,We actually maintain a,,
sd,"we have, a, we, we, we, we have a checking account that we treat like a savings",,
ad,scratch that,,
sd,we have a savings account that we treat like a checking account.,,
b,Huh-uh.,,
sd,"And so what we do is, we anytime we do or make or charge something, we write it out as if we wrote a check.",,
b,Huh-uh.,,
sd,And then at the end of the month all the money to MUMBLEx covered already.,,
sd,So we just pay it off without having to worry about any interest or anything.,,
b,Oh.,,
ba,That's a real good idea.,,
sd,It keeps us hopping.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"See, now I'd never get my wife to be able to follow that.",,
sd,Before we got married I had money in the bank.,,
sd,I owned my own home.,,

b,Huh-uh.,,

o,no,,
sd,it just didn't work anymore.,,
sd,She spends a lot.,,

sd,Maybe after awhile I'll rub off on her or something.,,
%,I don't think,,
sv,"Well, you know, you know, you know, what's always good is sort of a for savings, where they just take money out of you're pay.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"We did that for awhile where, um",,

b@,Huh-uh.,,

b,Huh-uh.,,
sd,"Um, but my wife has a real job.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,So does mine.,,
b,Yeah,,
sd,". What we do is, we take money out of her, out of her paycheck each week.",,
b,Huh-uh.,,
sd,"And put it, it goes directly to another account, that we don't, at an entirely different bank, that we don't have access to so easily",,
sd,and it goes there,,
sd,and it stays there,,
sd,and it builds up until we need it for something.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"See, I think we might have to do that.",,
sd,"Of course, she looks at what she brings home each week.",,
sd,"It's going to be hard for her to, uh, not have her own money. Because, like now, you know, I put money in the bank and saved to go back to graduate school for two years.",,
sd,And now she wants to go back to school,,
sd,but she saved enough maybe to get her through August.,,
b,Oh.,,
sd,"You know, and that's it.",,

sd,I don't know if my paltry graduate student fees are going to get us through.,,
sd,"It doesn't work, Ken.",,
b,Gee.,,
sd,"My mother always said, `` now, don't argue about money ''",,

b,Right.,,

ba,God.,,

sd,I got lucky.,,
sd,My wife apparently is not a,,
sd,she likes to spend,,
sd,but she's pretty good about things.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"Now, see my wife will do things like make clothes.",,
ba,Wow.,,
sd,"One of our, one of our big investments that, you know, I was wholeheartedly in favor of, was to buy a sewing machine. Because she makes clothes.",,
sd,"And, you know, a descent sewing machine will really help her out",,

ba@,That was great.,,

sd,"You know, so I guess I can't, you know, we've probably almost paid off the sewing with, uh",,

sd,"So I can't complain too much, you know",,
sd,"she's, she's good about that.",,
sd,"And, also, we, we dine at home a lot.",,
sd,"You know, she likes to cook.",,
sd,So that saves us from restaurants or whatever,,
sd,but,,

b,Right.,,
sv,Well,,

b,Yeah.,,

b,Huh-uh.,,

b,Right.,,
ba,Exactly,,
sd,but that to her is sort of like a waste.,,
b,Yeah.,,

%,So,,
ba,I know,,
sd,and those nails are so expensive,,
x,.,,
fe,"Oh, gosh.",,
sd,I was so excited when she decided she wasn't going to do her nails anymore.,,
sd,I guess she just stopped polishing them because they were yellow.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,And then she waits for them to get their color back.,,
sd,And then she'll polish them again.,,
sd,"I don't know, whatever.",,
sd,So she stopped for awhile.,,
sd,"Boy, what a difference.",,
sd,They buy nail polish every two weeks,,
%,"it's, uh",,
fe,", my gosh",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"And lotion, oh, my goodness, body lotion",,
b,"Oh, yeah.",,
sd,"we spend more on soft, on, on body lotions with sesame oil and all these different things, than, uh",,
sd,she must spend more on one application of body lotion than I do on soap for an entire year.,,
b,Yeah,,
sd,. Good old Ivory.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,It's funny.,,
qy^g,"Um, well, it's for your benefit though, right.",,
na,"Oh, I think so",,
sd,she's always soft.,,
sd,That's true.,,
ba,"MUMBLEx, so that's helpful.",,
aa,Yeah.,,
%,"But I think, um",,
h,I don't know,,
sd,"maybe after we're not in school anymore, we'll be much better at saving.",,
%,"I think, uh",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,"I think that's, uh",,
qy,Now do you still own a house ?,,
sd,You said you owned one.,,
ng,I sold my house.,,
sd,And that's what's really paying for my time unemployed or whatever.,,
ba,That's great.,,
+,"Because the graduate assistantship really doesn't cover, the ten thousand dollars in tuition, really doesn't cover living expenses. Um",,
b,Right.,,
sd,we actually live in two different places right now because she has her job.,,
sd,"So that makes it hard with, uh, you know",,
sd,"we're paying double rent, double utilities",,
ba,"Oh, wow.",,
sd,and that makes it sort of expensive,,
sd,"but see, I live within my",,
o@,MUMBLEx.,,
+,"I live within my me, very menial income",,
sd,and she doesn't.,,
sd,"She doesn't live within her professional income, you know.",,
%,So I just get a,,
sv,"that's the killer, two apartments",,
aa,yeah,,
sd,"and then even if we want to see each other on weekends, it's twenty-five, thirty dollars in gas, every weekend",,
sd,"and that really adds up too, you know",,
sd,so it gets tough,,
ba,Wow.,,
sd,"I think, we'll, do much better when we're living together and we're only paying one rent and one telephone.",,
sd,"You know, it will cut our telephone bills, you know, by five, by four-fifths, you know",,
ba,"Eventually, right.",,
%,I mean you're not going to,,
b,Right.,,
+,if she's here,,
sd,so it's actually tough this year,,
sd,but it will be better in June.,,
sd,She will move in with me in June,,
sd,so hopefully our budget will in increase then.,,
qy,Have you been married for long ?,,
nn,No.,,
sd,Just since December.,,
ba,"Oh, wow.",,
sd,So you guys really are newlyweds.,,
b,Yeah.,,

%,"So, you know, we lived within",,
sd,"though I had my own house and things, you know, we still, uh, we're still pretty close.",,

sd(^q),"My mother always said to me, `` Tom, now, the best thing to do is be like you're father.",,

sd,"And I was like, well, that's true my dad never said a word, you know.",,
b,Yeah.,,
%,So.,,
sd,I actually encourage my wife to spend money sometimes.,,

b,Yeah.,,
sd,"So I say if she wants to go out and buy something, I never argue with her, because she's real good at, you know, sort of MUMBLEx.",,
sd,I don't argue with her,,
sd,but I just get all,,
sd,it must show in my face.,,
sd,"Must be like, must be cringes or something, you know",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,especially yesterday or this past weekend.,,
sd,"We met half way between, at her parents house",,

bh,What else can you say ?,,
ba,That's right.,,
fx,I do recommend the for savings bit.,,
sd,"They, uh",,
b,Yeah.,,
%,I think,,
+,they take it out or your paycheck before you see it because it doesn't hurt.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,You don't notice it.,,
sd,I think that's probably a really good idea.,,
sv,"You know, you don't even think about it if it's gone.",,
b,Huh-uh.,,
b,Yeah,,
sd,"so, uh, until you really need it",,
sd,"and then you realize, you've got a couple of thousand dollars built up someplace else.",,
b,Yeah.,,
b^r,Yeah,,
%,see I was,,
sd,"when I had, when I was living alone and I had my own house and things, uh, I put one, I was paid twice a month",,
sd,one paycheck went into savings,,
sd,and one went into the checking account that paid the mortgage,,
b,Right.,,
+,and the food bills,,
%,and it,,
sd,"and I was even able to, you know, to accumulate some savings in a sense in the checking account, because I'm pretty thrifty",,
sd,"and, you know. But my wife likes to spend.",,
sd,She enjoys,,
sd,so that's fine.,,
%,But a,,
sd,"for savings, I'll have to look into that.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"that's, that's been our godsend, you know.",,
b,Huh-uh.,,
sd,"We've had some sort of major emergencies come up, you know, where",,
sd,we also own our own house,,
b,Huh-uh.,,

sd,"I mean, half the city owned trees MUMBLEx.",,
sd,One-third of all vegetation in this county is just wiped out.,,
qy^d,"Oh, really, because of the heavy ice.",,
ny,Yeah.,,
sd,It broke the limbs.,,
aa,Exactly.,,
b,Huh-uh.,,
sd,We had to MUMBLEx our backyard tremendous willow tree that just fortunately,,
sd,"but it cost us, you know, a couple of hundred dollars just to bring the tree down.",,
b,Right.,,
+,"I mean, just to take off what was broken.",,
sd,"Plus, we went with a friend",,
%,and they said you know,,
sd,"and then the whole ice storm cost us quite a bit of money, even though insurance picked up some of it",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,"still, not all of it.",,
%,"They don't get, you know",,
b,Huh-uh.,,
%,and that,,
%,plus,,
sd,and then we had a car expense like that same week.,,
sd,"One of the cars died, you know.",,
sd,All of this adds up,,
sd,and that for savings really comes in handy.,,
b,Yeah.,,
b^r,Yeah.,,
ba,I can see that.,,
%,I can that,,
sd(^q),"I keep trying to say to her, Laura don't spend so much.",,
^q,"What happens if something happens to a car, you know.",,
b,Right.,,
sd,"Oh, well, nothing will happen.",,
%,Oh.,,
o,All right,,
qw,what type of things would you fix if you're having company come over ?,,
sd,"Well, I have a really great one that I make in the summertime because it's cool",,
sd,"and it's, uh, it's just really pretty easy.",,
sd,It's pretty much dumping things in and stirring.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,And I like that.,,
sd,"Uh, the only thing you have to do is cook the rice that goes in, in it",,
sd,"and then I, you're supposed to do chicken",,
sd,but I just use those little cans of chicken.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,And it makes it so much easier,,
sd,and so you dump the rice,,
sd,you dump the chicken,,
sd,and then you put in fruit like pineapple and mandarin oranges and grape,,
sd,now grapes are the ones that you have to pull all that off,,
sd,but I get my kids to do that,,
%,so,,
sd,Oh.,,
sd,"I, I don't have to do that.",,
%,"And, um, and it really",,
sd,and you mix it all up with ye-,,
sd,there's a little dressing that goes in it that you have to stir up,,
sd,but it's so simple,,
sd,and it tastes really good because it's cool in the summertime.,,
b,"Oh, yeah.",,
qy,You serve it cold ?,,
ny,Uh-huh.,,
bk,"Oh, yeah",,
ba,that sounds good.,,
b,Yeah,,
sd,it has to sit in the fridge over night,,
sv,"but, but it's really good.",,
%,Um.,,
sd,And I like that one.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"Usually when we entertain we do something really simple, because I like to visit with my company",,
b,Yeah.,,
+,and not be scurrying around in the kitchen,,
sd,so,,
b,Exactly.,,
+,"a lot of times, we'll barbecue",,
sd,"like, uh, for Memorial Day we had some friends over",,
sd,and we just bought a brisket and marinated it overnight in one of those like Adolph's meat marinate,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,and put it on the smoker and cooked it.,,
ba,"Oh, that sounds good.",,
sd,"And tha-, it was real good.",,
sd,You can buy a fairly cheap piece of meat that way,,
sd,and then people think they're eating steak or something.,,
b,Yeah,,
b^r,yeah,,
qy^g,". And these days that helps, doesn't it ?",,
b,Yeah,,
b^r,yeah.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,It really does.,,
sd,I know what you mean.,,
sd,I don't usually I just pass on any recipe that's got more than five or six steps to it because I just know I'll never take the time to do it.,,
sd,Now spaghetti's such an easy one.,,
sd,"Um, I do that a lot.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,I do spaghetti a lot.,,
b,Yeah,,
sd,it seems like most people like spaghetti.,,
b,Yeah,,
sd,"I don't like to do that i-, if it's ho, real hot though.",,
b,Yeah.,,
h,"Because, um, I don't know",,
sd,"I have a real thing about being hot in the, in the summertime.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
b,I guess.,,
sv,Well I think when you heat your kitchen up it really makes a big difference,,
b,Yeah.,,
+,in your whole house.,,
aa,Yeah,,
sv,I think that's right.,,
sd,"And, um, we don't entertain that often",,
sd,"but when we do, I'm like you. I like it to be fast and easy.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,And something so that we can talk and not,,
b,Yeah.,,
+,and not have to worry about being in the kitchen all the time.,,
%,Most,,
sd,"we don't entertain like people from work or stuff e-, often.",,
sd,It's usually friends from church and stuff,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd(^q),"and it's usually kind of like, you want to come over, and they say well what can we bring.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,And so it's real easy because you just make one or two things,,
sd,and everybody else brings something.,,
sd,"That's exactly like us, from our church, we just do it",,
aa,yeah.,,
ba,Oh yeah,,
b,yeah.,,
%,Uh.,,

sd,We had,,

b,Sure,,
b^r,sure.,,

sd,"But, but then it's something that's hard to enforce too I'm sure.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
aa,It sure is.,,
%,"The, you know, as far as",,
sv,I think there was something with the government official that went on conferences for two days,,
sv,"and actually, uh, the conferences were nothing",,
sd,"but, uh, you know, they're getting paid for this",,
sd,and it was something more than just the conferences.,,
sd,"They were using it as eating out, uh",,
sd,"when you think about people, uh, taking vacations these big government officials taking descendants in congress.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,The rest of them taking these vacations and using the taxpayers' money for that.,,
b,Right.,,
sv,"And it's a real big crunch, uh",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"of course, when they get caught then they're, you know, they're guilty of course",,

b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,but I'm not sure that that's really that much of the problem.,,

ba,Exactly.,,
sv,"And I don't think, uh, it's ended up being",,
sd,I mean it gave people jobs,,
b,Yeah.,,

sv,"but after that that's, you know, uh",,

b,Right.,,
sd,They all take the exact same starter.,,
sd,They'll interchange completely.,,
sd,I mean completely.,,
sd,One starter will fit all of them.,,
sd,So they've got a whole lot of torque,,
sd,"but to do that, they did it",,
sd,use an underdrive system,,
sd,but they geared it down so the motor spins really fast,,
b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,it's kind of tough on the bushings.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,Usually what goes is the bushings.,,
b,Right.,,

sd,"But, uh, most places don't put, don't rebuild them with, with g, with good enough bushings.",,

sd,"I guess it's, it comes out sporadically, like",,

qy^g,"As far as the number of drug users, you mean ?",,
ny,Yeah,,
b,Huh.,,
sd^e,as far as the number of people they actually found that were drug users.,,
sd,"But I think that when I was at T I of course, we had all the information before they started.",,
b,Right.,,
sd,And they said that a certain number of people that the heavy drug users would either quit or go in rehabilitation programs.,,
sv,"And I think that's what helps, you know, that in the warning that you have a drug program, the people that are worried about it or are taking drugs, actually go",,
sv,and then usually a lot of them partake in some of the benefits of rehabilitation and everything.,,
b,Right,,
b,yeah,,
sv,so that's real beneficial for the company and the employee.,,
b,Yeah,,
sd,and our numbers have been way down.,,
sd,I don't know what they were.,,
sd,When I worked for the temporary agency as a permanent person,,
%,and so we had,,
sd,"when we sent temporaries to T I, we had to have their drug tested.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"And we did have a couple of cases where we really, the person said that they hadn't used anything",,
sd,and their test came back positive,,
sd,and normally we didn't retest them.,,
sd,But there were a couple of people that we really thought that they were telling the truth,,
sd,and we retested them like the next day,,
sd,and they came back negative,,
b,"Oh, really.",,
+,the second time.,,
sv,"So that, that's the only thing, I think, that might be a little bit of a problem.",,
%,"Oh, you're",,
sv,that's a good point,,
sd,"but at T I they, before they had the testing, I've forgotten, seems like it's a year ago September, something like that, they told us that the agency that did it was the one that did it for the government.",,
sd,"And, of course, that's critical, just as the point that you brought up that whoever does your testing's got to be, you know, have a lot of quality control, that they keep track of everything.",,
sd,They don't make mistakes.,,
sv,That would be terribly embarrassing,,
b,Right.,,
+,for someone to really come back positive,,
sd,and they were not.,,
sd,And I haven't heard of any,,
sd,now I'm not in personnel or anything.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"But, uh, they say that there, it's almost down to zero where people come back and say they are positive and they're not.",,
sd,"In other words, there's very few mistakes",,
sd,"and that, of course, has got to be critical.",,
sv,"It's got to be, if you have a drug testing program",,
sv,"it's got to be with a very, very good agency.",,
sv,You don't just have some local group do it.,,
sv,It's got to be a highly qualified agency.,,
b,Right,,
b,yeah,,
sd,not just some doctor's office somewhere.,,
aa,No,,
sv,you don't want to do that.,,
sv,It's got to be a laboratory that does quality control and double check.,,
sd,And I think that T I is latched themselves up with an established group.,,
sv,"And that would be good for any company that does it, and not to have just a very casual thing.",,
sv,"It's got to be with a, you know, first class, totally independent agency. Not local of course.",,
sv,"Ours, I think, well I think it was in the south somewhere",,
sd,"but it wasn't even in Dallas, you know, the one that did us.",,
b,Oh really.,,
aa,Yeah.,,
qy,Huh. Do they have a policy where they counsel people if they come back positive,,
qrr,or do they fire them right away.,,
nn,"Oh, no.",,
sd^e,They're not fired.,,
sd,"They are, they have one chance to then go in a program.",,
sd,"You come back positive, you have one chance to go in, and go into, they have a lot of, uh, rehabilitation, both for alcohol and for drug use",,
sd,"and they have, uh, a lot of, uh, they have an agency where you can go for personal problems, financial or whatever.",,
b,Right.,,
sd,"And so they, they, they don't",,
nn,no,,
sd^e,it's not firing first.,,
sd,"It's, uh, definitely trying to encourage people to rehabilitate.",,
sd,"In fact, again, before you go, you know, that's why I said, when they first started it, they had a rehabilitation program in effect that said if you worried about this and you may have taken drugs, go ahead and get rehabilitated first",,
sd,and they won't say anything about it.,,
b,Right.,,
sv,I think that's really good.,,
b,Oh sure.,,
sd,I know some places just fire people on the spot if they come back positive or something.,,
b,Oh yeah,,
aa,no,,
sv,that's not right.,,
sv,"It's really an illness, or whatever you want to say that it is.",,
sv,"You know, it's a weakness and all",,
sv,"and who, all of us have weaknesses of one kind or another.",,
sv,And I think that those people that have that and however they got into it,,
sd,I have children,,
sd,"I always worry about the, the classical thing that you see on T V, where the drug pushers give it to the kids for free, you know, and get them sucked in",,
sd,and then they sell it to them.,,
sd,You know,,
b,Right.,,
+,the classical thing is to give it away.,,
sd,I always worry about my teenage daughters going to some party,,
sd,and they slip it to them.,,
h,I don't know,,
sd,"I don't even have that much knowledge to know whether that would get them addicted or not, you know.",,
sd,That's a real worry.,,
b,Yeah,,
sd,"some of the stories you read about cocaine, that's like people try it one time and they're addicted.",,
sd,My husband is a counselor,,
sd,"and he works, mostly with adolescents.",,
qy^d,"Oh, you know a lot about that.",,
ny,So yeah,,
sd^e,I hear a lot of horror stories about things like that.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,But most of the time it's they get into the wrong crowd first,,
sd,and then they start a drug problem.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,"It's usually not a one time accidental thing, I don't think.",,
b,Yeah,,
ba,I know,,
sd,I'm glad of that.,,
sd,"And I have, knock wood, pretty good luck, or very good luck with my daughters so far",,
sd^c,that's my conference call,,
sd,I have one daughter still at home.,,
sd,One's at U T,,
sd,"and one's at home, gets dozen calls a night.",,
ad,"Oh, well I'll let you go if you want to go ahead and take that",,
ar,No,,
ar^r,no,,
sd,I don't care about that,,
sd,she'll be on the phone all night.,,
b,Yeah,,
sv,it seems if you watch what kind of crowd that start running around with and kind of keep up with who their friends are,,
b,Right.,,
+,"that's best way to avoid trouble, from what I can gather.",,
qy,Do you have children ?,,
nn,No,,
sd^e,not yet,,
sd,we're expecting a baby,,
ba,"Oh, great",,
+,in July,,
sd,so we're starting.,,
sv,Fantastic experience.,,
sd,"I've got two, as I said, I've at U T now in Austin, and one at home",,
sd,and I always say that I've learned so much more from them than I ever taught them.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,It's a fantastic experience.,,
sd,"Oh, we're really excited about it.",,
b,Oh yeah.,,
sd,"You know, one thing my husband believes is if you suspect your kids are having any kind of problems, he believes you should take your kids in for a random testing, like on a Saturday morning, if they've been out at a party Friday night.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"If you're not too sure what's going on, he tells parents all the time, haul them into the doctor's office and get them checked.",,
sv,"The key thing that I think, that we try to do, is that bring all the friends over here.",,
sv,"Have our house as a place where they can come at any time, so that you always see their friends",,
b,Right.,,
+,rather than make them not welcome,,
sv,and they're always over in someone else's house.,,
sd,"So our, we've been lucky that our house is usually the place where the kids could come, you know.",,
b,Uh-huh,,
b,yeah,,
sv,I think that's a really good thing to encourage.,,
sv,"And then you can keep an eye, you can make judgments and make comments or whatever you want.",,
sv,But at least you see what's going on,,
sv,"and you always have your house welcome, then your children think that, you know, you're cool parents and all that.",,
b,Right.,,
fo,Well good luck with your expected baby there.,,
ft,"Oh well, thanks.",,
sd,"My wife was yelling, was talking in my ear",,
sd,"she said, reminded me to say that they're very cheap until they get to start driving.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And we have one, of course, I say, in college driving. And one going to drive this summer",,
sd,"so kids are, cost you practically nothing, because you always get so many things from your relatives and everything.",,
sd,"But you wait until they go and get a car, insurance, that's when they get expensive.",,
sd,As they get older,,
b,Yeah.,,
+,"you know, they cost practically nothing from one to five",,
sd,and then slowly but surely starts to creep up when they start to take lessons,,
sd,but it's well worth it and everything.,,
b,Yeah,,
b,"uh, yeah",,
sd,I think it'll be neat.,,
sv,"Be a, be a great experience really.",,
qy^c,You still there ?,,
ny@,Yea.,,
bk,Okay,,
sd,I thought I was cut off there.,,
o@,MUMBLEx.,,
sd,"You know, I don't have much to say about drug testing.",,
aa,No,,
sd^e,I can't think of anything else to say about that either.,,
qy^t,So you've done this ten times ?,,
ny,Yeah.,,
qy^t,Did you get the booklet on how to get the gifts and all ?,,
nn,No,,
sd^e,I don't work for T I,,
sd^t,so I get cash.,,

sd^t,I didn't know what they were going to do.,,
sd^t,They sent us a little booklet,,

b,Right.,,
ba,Well that great.,,
qw^t,Well what kind of cash ?,,
sd^t,I've forgotten what they going to do.,,

qy^t,Was it five dollars a call ?,,
ny,Yeah,,
sd^e^t,five dollars a call.,,
sd^t,"Well, hope they follow through and everything.",,

ad^t,so I guess we better get off.,,
aa,Right,,
aa,yeah,,
fc,It was good talking to you.,,
fc,Alright.,,
fc,Bye-bye now.,,
fc,Bye.,,
sd,"Well, Wayne, I've never done any, uh, auto repairs myself at all.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"I mean, I may have screwed in a little, screw that looked like it was falling out on the door or something",,
sd,"but, uh, I personally haven't done anything.",,
sd,"Maybe I've, uh, changed win-, wiper blades or something",,
sd,"but I have noticed since, uh, I got married that my husband, he hates to do auto repairs",,
sd,"but he would rather do them himself than, than to pay someone else.",,
sd,"I guess, he can't make himself pay someone to do the repairs when he knows, he knows how to do it",,
sd,and he'll do it.,,
sd,"So, he, he hates the time that he takes",,
sd,"but he has changed, um, the brakes",,
sd,and he has done all of the tune-ups,,
sd,and the MUMBLEx like that,,
sd,and recently he changed the steering mechanism in the car.,,
sd,I was really impressed with that.,,
sd,We had to have it to get the car inspected,,
sd,it wouldn't pass inspection,,
sd,"and, and so, he priced around",,
sd,and everyone wanted several hundred dollars for it,,
sd,"so, he thought, well, I can get one in a junkyard, for like fifty dollars, which he did",,
sd,"and then, he did it",,
sd,"and, so, I guess, uh, he's been pretty good about keeping our cars up",,
qo,"what, uh, what's your experience been like ?",,
sd,"Well, I, uh, I have a long experience with cars.",,
sd,"I, uh, when I was younger, uh, my brother had a Corvette",,
sd,and I bought a Corvette,,
sd,and when you have a Corvette you more or less do all the work,,
sd,"and I've done everything from build the motor from the, uh, you know, the bare block on up.",,
sd,"And, I, I'm the same way as your husband is when it comes to my car, I hate to go pay somebody good money, you know",,
sd,I hate to pay somebody twenty-five dollars on hour for something I can do myself.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"It just, to me it makes absolutely no economic sense to do that.",,
b,Right.,,
sd,"In fact, I, um, just this past weekend put new plugs in both, uh, my car an my wife's car.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And so, I, uh, I pretty much try to troubleshoot and do everything I can do myself",,
sd,"but I've, I've gotten to the point in my life, um, you know, I just crept over forty years old, where I don't want to crawl underneath the car anymore.",,
ba,That makes sense.,,
sd,"I mean it's, um, I don't know whether I've, I've just reached a point, you know",,
sd,"it's, it's real rough in the winter time.",,
b,"Huh, yes.",,
sd,"And, uh, so, I try to make sure that, uh, by the time fall runs around, because we actually have winters here on the east coast, um",,
b,Right.,,
+,"that, uh, I have, you know, the car's in pretty good shape enough to last through the winter",,
sd,"and, uh, then springtime I usually end up giving them, the, uh, a tune-up and make sure that they're running well",,
sd,"and, uh, you know, it's like I had the muffler go out on my, on my car, shortly before it was required to go",,
sd,"in Maryland they have, uh, emission tests.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,And you're required to get your car and go through the emission test,,
sd,"well, my muffler, of course, starting going bad right before I was supposed to go to the emission test",,
sd,"so. You know, I had to do that job",,
sd,"and of course, that was back in December when it's nice and cold outside.",,
b,Yes,,
ba,I'm sure it was.,,
sd,But the thing was that I could do the job myself,,
sd,"I mean, the parts cost me, oh, roughly a hundred dollars.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"Um, if I'd taken it someplace and have it done it was going to be three hundred twenty-five.",,
b,Right.,,
qh,Now like who's got that extra two and a quarter,,
sd,I know I don't.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"Well, that's exactly the way he feels is that, he really hates to spend the time",,
sd,it takes a lot of time,,
sd,"if he, if he thinks it's going to be two hours, it's four if, you know, whatever, it always takes him twice as long.",,
sd,"But then when he's finished he's, he always says, well, now you owe me three hundred dollars.",,
sd,"And then he thinks that he has the money that, that he can spend on something",,
sd,and he hasn't given it to someone else.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"So, he gets some satisfaction out of that although, generally I think he, he does not look forward to or anticipate",,
sd,there's some people that enjoy tinkering around on cars.,,
sd,There's a lot of people,,
sd,and he just isn't one of them.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"I, uh, I don't mind it",,
sd,"um, there was a time when I had my Corvette",,
sd,"I mean, of course, I loved it, um",,
%,"but if, you know",,
sd,I've got other interests now,,
sd,"and there's a lot, lo-, other more important things I think I should be doing with my time.",,
sd,And I have the same problem,,
ad,"I mean, you can tell him from me",,
sd,but it doesn't matter,,
sd,"I mean, I've, I've had greasy fingernails for years.",,
sd,And it still takes me twice as long as I think it's going to take to do the job,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"so, but, th-, I think the difference is that, uh, when you own the car you take more care in what you're doing",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,and you want to make sure that it's done right and put back together right,,
sd,"and, you know, I've, I've in the past I've had brake jobs done by someone that when I went back and looked at it some months later I'd find something drastically wrong with it",,
b,Right.,,
+,"you know, like a spring that was put in incorrectly which could have resulted in brakes failing and me having an accident.",,
b,Right.,,
+,"You know, those kind of things",,
sd,"and when you have a vehicle that's being used by, you know, other members of your family, you know, you don't want that kind of a situation to come up.",,
b,No.,,
sv,"And it's very, very difficult to find a mechanic these days that you can trust.",,
sd,I only have one guy that I know that I trust to work on my car.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And, uh, he's about sixty miles from here.",,
%,"And so, it",,
sd,"and if I have something that's really major that I can't handle or feel I don't have the time to handle, I'll take it to him to do it.",,
b,Right,,
sd,"you know, that it's, uh, really has a bad reputation is to feel that, that people in general feel and have, have rightly so, I think been cheated many times",,
b@,Uh-huh,,
b@,Yes.,,
sd,"and, um, and well, I know once when we had a",,
sd,we usually MUMBLEx inspection time we find out there's something wrong with our car,,
sd,"but, um, once the muffler needed to be changed",,
sd,"and, uh, he had looked at him himself",,
sd,"and, but we saw a commercial for like fourteen or twenty dollars or something for a change",,
sd(^q),"he said, that's really, really good",,
sd,"so, he went in",,
sd,"and, uh, but when they quoted him a price they really wanted fifty or something.",,
sd,"Anyway, but the car that the muffler people had, um, my, at least my husband felt that they had damaged the muffler further, you know",,
sd,they had punctured a big hole in it when it really could have just been patched or whatever,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"and so, since then, I don't think he's ever even seriously considered a, you know, any kind of job he thought he could do himself.",,
sd,"But, I know from his childhood, he says that his father always buys and restores cars just as entertainment, I guess.",,
sd,"And, um, so, Kelly growing up, he, he felt like that, that was a good way on Saturdays that he developed a good relationship with his father.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And so, he used, they used car repairs kind of as a way to have a, you know, something that they did together",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"and he thought that turned out pretty good because it, you know, it helped him to understand and be functional now",,
sd,and it helped him to have a close relationship,,
sd,"so, that's one, one way he looked at it.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"that's probably, uh, uh, something that, uh, is, is you know, is good for both of them.",,
sd,"I know that, uh, my older son I could never get him interested in cars",,
sd,"and I couldn't, you know",,
sd,"I just like, you know",,
^q,you sure you're a boy,,
^q,"I mean, your not interested in cars",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"I mean he, he just would not have anything to do with them.",,
sd,"And, uh, later on and like when he, you know, grew up, got out of the house, got his own car, um, he didn't know how to do anything to it. I mean, absolutely nothing.",,
sd,"I mean, he couldn't even check the oil.",,
sd,"I mean, that's, that's how uninformed he was and disinterested.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And, I guess there are some people out there like that, um, you know",,
sd,"I always thought maybe, you know, if he took more of an interest and, you know, what I was doing",,
sd,and maybe we could have communicated better.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
b,"But, uh, yeah",,
ba,"I, I think that's great.",,
b,Yeah,,
sd,it didn't always work.,,
sd,"Well, I felt, um, I feel like I could myself, do some things but, that I have enough responsibility that if I have someone like my father when I was living at home, and my husband, that's willing to do it, I go ahead and let them do it.",,
sd,"I don't feel the need to, um, you know, be a feminist on that issue and say I can take care of my own things.",,
sd,"I'm, I'm happy to let them ru, run the cars because I have so, many other responsibilities that, um",,
sd,"so, I haven't tried to do a lot myself.",,
sd,"Uh, I trained my, uh, my wife in the hou-, in, in doing things",,
sd,"in fact, uh, when I, uh, first transferred down to, uh, Texas Instruments back in nineteen eighty-seven",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"um, uh, when I left here, uh, she had to change a set of plugs on the car",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"because she was up here for a month or so, after I was",,
sd,"and, uh, it was an interesting experience for her.",,
sd,"I mean, she'd always assisted me and done some other things",,
sd,"but for her to actually get in there and do it herself it was, uh, it was something, t-, a little different.",,
ba,It's a good experience,,

sd,If you go to a doctor who isn't in the network then it will be less benefits that you get.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"We have some dental coverage now, um",,
sd,but you have to pay a little more to really get something worthwhile.,,
sd,"Like, I've had a couple of crowns recently",,

b,Yeah,,
ba,it can.,,

sd,and I know when you first start out working you're not thinking about that.,,

sv(^q),"After you've been working for a while and you look at your pension account and you go, is that all that's in there.",,

sd,"Um, we do have a new thing that they've started a few years ago, um",,
sd,it's not an I R A,,

sd,"and, you know, he has all that",,
sd,"and with his doctors and stuff, they have, um, a list of doctors that the employees can go to",,
sd,and it only costs a dollar as long as they go to that doctor.,,
b,"Oh, yeah",,
b,okay.,,
sd,"You know, and I think it works the same way with his prescriptions and stuff if he needs any.",,
sd,"But you have to go, you know, to certain ones",,
sd,but still that works out really nice.,,
%,"You know, it",,
b,Yeah,,
sd,"we're doing an H M O right now, um",,

sd,"like my husband always takes MUMBLEx which is kind of like, you know, Contact stuff, only better.",,
%,"Um, you",,
sd,that's like a buck a capsule.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,So if you've got thirty in there it normally comes out to about thirty-four dollars so when you pay five it's a pretty good savings.,,

b,Uh-huh.,,

aa,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"I, I thought it would be good, too",,
sv,but I did not think it would be good that they all do something like the Peace Corps,,
b,Yeah.,,

b,Uh-huh.,,

sv,but there's a lot of other public service things,,
b,"Oh, sure.",,

b,"Oh, yeah",,
sv,"and, and even, even in our home towns there's a lot of",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

b,Right.,,

b,Right.,,
+,"and alcohol and, and just, uh, helping old people, and, um, uh, you know, helping cripple, just helping somebody else",,
b,Yes,,
b,yeah.,,
sv,"and I think that art of giving is something that, um, we don't have very much any more.",,

b,Yeah,,

sd,That's what I wondered.,,
b,yeah,,

b,Right.,,

aa,"Oh, yeah",,
aa^r,oh yeah,,
sv,I agree with you.,,
sv,"This is something that, um, like you say, is it's character building",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

%,and,,
sv,"Well, I think sometimes it gives you a better picture of what some of the other people live like, you know, what",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

b,Right.,,
+,even other parts of the neighborhood,,
b,Uh-huh,,
b^r,uh-huh,,
b,yeah.,,
+,"some of the people, how they live",,
%,or,,
aa,"Oh, I agree with you",,
aa^r,I agree with you,,
sv,"and I think, uh, young people are so, um, uh, focused just on themselves and their activities, and whose going out with whom, et cetera",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"that, uh, you know, to get a taste of what the real world is actually about",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,doing that public service would be great.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
b,Yeah.,,
b,Yeah,,
sv,"because that's one thing that's hard, with young people, you, you can't tell them how things are",,
b,Right.,,
sv,they have to see for themselves,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,now of course this might be after they've gone through their teen years,,
sv,I don't know what their thought is on what age that this should be done.,,
b,"Oh, yeah",,
sv,"I would think so, like right after, um, high school",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"you know, even if it was the, the, their, um, that summer right after high school",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"you know, three months",,
sv,Of course they've already gone through the period of time where they need more direction,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"you know, they, their teenage years and that they really sometimes need a little better direction to go",,
b,Uh-huh,,
b^r,uh-huh.,,
+,and something,,
sv,"course now Peace Corps, that couldn't be done of course, until they were done with school",,
b,Right,,
b^r,right,,
+@,so,,
sv,"You know, something that out, that was outside of, uh, outside of school",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
o,yeah,,
o,"but, yeah",,
sv,"you know, right, right after you graduate from, um, high school, because a lot of people are just, um, uh, Well gee whiz, what do I do now",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,if they're not focused on going to college,,
sv,"and, uh, you know, having that, that, uh, gung ho plan",,

sv,Kind of an in-between,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,time.,,
b,Uh-huh,,
b,yeah,,
sv,"so to me, see that would be the, the, uh, the greatest time for, um, you know, teenagers to, to do that, would be right after they graduated from high school.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,But as for its being required,,
b,Yeah.,,

b,Huh-uh.,,

aa,No,,

sv,but,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
+,"not all certainly would be geared to, even the, the Mormon boys that go out, not all of them go",,
sv,I mean,,
b,Right.,,
+,it's disaster if they don't go,,
sv,but,,
b,"Oh, right.",,

b,Huh-uh.,,

b,Right,,
b^r,right,,

sd,We just dropped it down there,,
sd,"and, the captain had, you know, some kind of sonar in the boat",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

b,Yeah.,,

b,Yeah,,

b,Yeah.,,
sd,"If you want to go on a boat alone, it's like two hundred dollars a day.",,
b,Yeah.,,
sd,"But this is great, because it was, I think it was nineteen dollars for five hours and twenty dollars for six hours or something.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
%,You know,,
sd,"so you'd get to go out there for, five-, for, for six hours and get a nice suntan and bring along some lunch and, and fish all day.",,

qo,What do you think about the benefits in jobs ?,,
sd,"Um, I'm, I'm relatively satisfied with the benefits I have.",,
sd,"I think that, um, our health insurance is terribly expensive.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,I'd rather that we got a bit more coverage for a lot less money.,,
sd,"But, um, you know, that's, that's my major complaints, I guess.",,
qo,What about you ?,,
ny,Yeah,,
sd^e,and a lot of times they turn down your claims,,
sd,so that leaves you paying for all of it.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"Or, or maybe that it's not understood what should be covered and what isn't.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
aa,Yeah.,,
aa,Right,,
sd,the,,
b,Yeah,,
o@,I,,
+,health insurance I have is Met Life,,
%,"and, if",,
sd,"it's the type that if you go to a certain doctor then, uh, you just pay ten dollars",,
sd,"and then, uh, the insurance pays the rest of the bill.",,
sd,"Or if you go outside you get, uh, seventy thirty.",,
+@,I see.,,
%,Now we,,
sd,I have just the regular insurance so that any doctor is covered,,
sd,"but what I found recently is what they've been doing is they, they poll somehow the area",,
sd,and then they have what they consider a justifiable price for the area where your doctor is located based on zip code.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"And so recently, when, when we had a claim, um, they didn't pay the eighty-five percent they paid much lower",,
sd(^q),"and when I called they said, Oh well, that's because your doctor is charging much more than the norm for the area.",,
sd*,"And I was really surprised because either there aren't that many of that type of doctor within that zip code, so that, you know, two doctors could balance each other out, or their, you know, their statistics aren't very accurate.",,
b,Right.,,
sv,"And, and they're probably doing it to their benefit, anyway.",,
%,So,,
b,Yeah,,
sv,"I would assume that you know, whatever doctors are willing to do the paperwork and send it in.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"But it's, it's difficult.",,
qo,"What about other, other benefits ?",,
qo,Are there others that you're dissatisfied with ?,,
sd,"Well, I work for Sears",,
sd,"and, and, um, that's about the, the only real benefit you have, is health insurance.",,
qy^d,"Well, you have vacation, I mea",,
ny,Yeah,,
ny^r,yeah,,
ar,but everybody gets vacation.,,
sd,"I mean, like, uh, T I and some other places, you know, they have so-, recreational facilities",,
sd,and they have a driving range and weight room,,
sv,"and, you know, I think they even have a swimming pool",,
b,Huh.,,
sd,and I don't know if they have any tennis courts or anything like that.,,
b,Yeah,,
sd,I'm not familiar with that sort of thing,,
sd,"but you know, to me vacation is, is an issue",,
sv,"and I mean, different places have different amounts of vacation, I would assume.",,
b,Right.,,
sd,"And, um, you know, the leniency with which they let you take leave without pay, perhaps or, um, I don't know, I suppose, um, sick days.",,
sv,Some places count the number of hours,,
sv,and some places just sort of believe you.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"Um, ours is based on number of days",,
sd,"and, you know, people try to build them up in case they really do get seriously ill.",,
b,Right.,,
b,Right.,,
sd,"But, um, otherwise, I'm not aware of any problems with the benefits around here.",,
sv^t,So maybe that covers the topic then.,,
b,Yeah.,,
sv,"Well, I don't know, the work, the working conditions, you know, if you could include that in benefits.",,
sv,Some places aren't very safe to work.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"And, and some places don't compensate you for the hazards that you, that you have to work under.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"Or maybe a ben-, uh, not really a benefit, either, but would be the allowing you to use the telephone for personal calls.",,
b,Right,,
b,uh-huh.,,
sv,"Um, but, you know I suppose some places are, are more stringent about that than others.",,
aa,Yeah,,
sv,I think so.,,
sv,"And, and, maybe arriving late or something like that, you know",,
sv,"how, how they enforce the rules.",,
b,Uh-huh,,
x,.,,
sd,"But other than that I don't have much feeling for, for the benefits",,
sd,"since, like I said, um, I don't have a big problem with, with them.",,
sd,"Um, work-, workmen's comp is a big thing now in, in Texas because, um, um, how much it costs the employers",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"and a, a lot of them are going to their own insurance now.",,
sd,"And it reduces some of the length of the benefits, and, uh, and I don't know besides that.",,
sd,"But I, I noticed right off that was a year less than what the state was allowing.",,
sd;qy^d,"Oh I, I didn't know that somebody could avoid workmen's compensation.",,
sd;no,"Well, well, they still have to pay it",,
sd,but they buy their own instead of going through the state.,,
bk,"Oh, I see.",,
sd,So apparently it costs less that way.,,
b,Uh-huh,,
b^r,uh-huh.,,
sv,"I suppose that whenever companies can avoid, um, benefits, it's to the, to, to the benefit of the company",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"and at least, you know, financially in the short run",,
sv,but I would think they would get a much greater turnover,,
sv,and that people would be dissatisfied,,
o@,working for them.,,
aa,Yeah.,,
sd,"That's what I, what I think",,
sv,"the-, they should be able, they should be able to judge their benefits on how happy their employees are",,
sv,and how much profit they're making,,
sv*,instead of trying to cut everything down,,
sv,"and then have everybody be unhappy and, and have a constant turnover of people.",,
+@,Right.,,
sv,"I mean, sure, the payroll is lower that way",,
sv,"but I would assume that the productivity is way down, also.",,
aa,Yeah,,
sv,the productivity and the training costs,,
sv,"if they have to train the same employee, a new employee every six months, then I don't see how they can save money.",,
b,Uh-huh,,

sd,and she had the cat there for two days,,

sv,"Uh, far as, you know, crime in the cities, I'm sure, like in yours it's pretty, pretty bad.",,

b,Uh-huh.,,
+,are the two top ones that we have.,,
qo,How about you ?,,
h,"Uh, well, I don't actually live in the city",,
aap,but I'd probably say that's roughly right.,,
sv,I mean crimes against property seem to outnumber crimes against life,,
sv,"but I, I think with the current war on drugs and all this kind of stuff I'd say probably the police department would claim the number one crimes, crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution, uh, and sale of drugs.",,
aa,Uh-huh.,,

b,Uh-huh.,,

qy,"is there anything, uh, that you particularly are concerned with in your particular area as far as security and that sort of thing ?",,

sd,I mean I can basically leave my front door unlocked and not have to worry about it.,,
sd,"Uh, but I do have friends that live in the city",,
sv,"and I think that they get a lot of fallout from this war on drug thing. Uh, just because there are, like, crack houses, you know, on their street and stuff like this.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
qr,"Do you live in a real small town or, or out in the country ?",,

b^m,About fifteen miles.,,

b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,but it's pretty congested.,,
sd,We are considered in the country,,
%,Um.,,
sv,but it doesn't really feel like you're in the country.,,
%,Um.,,
sv,"Our major crimes in our immediate town, uh, is probably robberies, house robberies",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

sv,"However, I'm sure they're there.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"But, uh, right now our neighborhood is running about, uh, eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed",,
ba,Wow.,,

sv,That's huge.,,
sd,"And since that time everybody's got some sort of burglar system or, you know, uh, burglar alarms",,

b^r,Uh-huh.,,
+,sensors and things like that.,,
sd,"It's cut back, you know, considerably",,
sv,"but it, it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to other neighborhood",,
sv,"so it still, uh, remains city wide, pretty, pretty high.",,
qy,"Are there, are there any theories on why this is happening ?",,

%,Most,,
qw,But why ?,,
qw,Why is it happening ?,,

sd,and both people are working.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,So they're happening during the hours they're gone from work.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sv,"Uh, so, uh, I would say that's probably their prime motivation.",,
sv,"They'll, they'll stock your house and, uh, look at your pattern and then go from there.",,
qy^d,So they're professionals ?,,
na,"Uh, they classify most of them as professionals.",,
%,Um.,,

b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,"guns, that sort of stuff.",,
%,Um.,,
sd,"Very few, you know, penny, penny ante stuff.",,
qw,"Well, what do you think can be done to reduce that sort of crime ?",,
sv,"Well, uh, the police force, for one",,
sv,"I think they could, uh, definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use.",,

sv,"oh, right now I think, we are about thirty thousand people",,
sd,and there's only eight officers that patrol for thirty,,
b,Uh-huh.,,

b^r,Uh-huh.,,
+,which is not very many.,,
b,Right.,,
%,And,,
sv,"But, I mean, that's going to tend to",,
sv,I mean it seems to me that sort of approach will tend to simply make the cost of committing the crime slightly higher,,
sv,"in other words, you've increased the probability of somebody being caught a little bit.",,
sv,The real question is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes in the first place.,,
%,"Well, the",,
sd,"course in our particular state, uh, we have the prison overcrowding, whatever",,
sd,"so they're giving the early release, uh",,
b,Right.,,
sd,"They're doing that in our state, too.",,
b,Yeah,,
%,"and, and it's",,

qy,So you think that would be a deterrent ?,,
na,"That would be, certainly be a deterrent.",,
b,Uh-huh.,,

ad,"You know, if they're overcrowded, just keep cramming them in there till they just suffocate. Uh",,
qw,"Well, what about an innocent person who happens to have been found guilty ?",,

b,Right.,,
%,Uh,,
bf,"So you'd, you'd rather see it harder to convict somebody.",,

b,Yeah,,

b,Yeah.,,
b^m,Yeah,,

b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"Uh, we've had a couple instances where break ins where the people have actually, you know, shot the people",,

^q,you can't get all of us.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,

b,Yeah.,,
sd,here you break in,,
sd,and you're going to get shot.,,
b,Yeah,,
sv,"that's, I mean that's certainly a possibility in, in",,

sv,"But, uh, it's a problem",,

b,Yeah.,,

sv,and,,
b,Yeah.,,

aa,Uh-huh.,,
aa,"I mean, I, I tend to agree with you.",,

b,Right.,,

sv,"And I think one of the big things that you can do is, to increase deterrence is, uh, if someone is found guilty of a, uh, felony level offense, they lose their citizenship.",,
sd,And they lose their constitutional rights.,,

sd,but,,
b,Yeah.,,

sd,other than doing our own work I prefer it to a professional.,,
sd,"Well, our house in New Mexico, it was stucco",,

b,Yeah.,,
sd,And we did basically seventy-five percent of the house,,
sd,and then I was afraid to do the eaves way up high and stuff.,,
b,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"So, I hired this man to come in and do it. A young kid.",,

sd,Scaffold.,,
sd^m,scaffold.,,
sd,That's it.,,

sd,and I think he charged me a hundred dollars to finish up.,,

%,Its,,
+,all the places that I had left for him were above huge humongous cactus,,
b,Yeah.,,

b,Uh-huh.,,

sd,and she wrung all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint,,
b^r,Uh-huh.,,
sd,so she had to start all over again,,
b^r,Uh-huh.,,
sd,"and when he got outside, he noticed his receipt was like thirteen ninety-nine or something.",,
ba,"Oh, my word.",,
sd,And he saw MUMBLEx.,,
bf,So that was really worth it. Painting his own house.,,
aa,Yeah,,
sd,it was like over two hundred dollars worth of free stuff.,,
ba,"Oh, my word.",,
ba^r,"Oh, my word.",,
sd,"Well, he really saved in that way.",,
b,Yeah.,,
b^m,"But, yeah",,
sd,"I think we are going to do, uh, another bathroom",,

sd,I want to do it about the same color. And just be a little,,
sv,Uh. Rollers are so messy.,,
sd,We never MUMBLEx any more.,,
aa,"Oh, I know.",,
